# Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

## Executive Summary

### Introduction (opener)


### Overview and Goals

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:
1. Using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
    - [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an alternative
        - `conda install -c conda-forge praw`
        - [Setup and short demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgfgtzIhBQ)
2. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.


#### About the API

Pushshift's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is use the following url: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?subreddit=boardgames

To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use the API: https://youtu.be/AcrjEWsMi_E

**NOTE:** Pushshift now limits you to 100 posts per request (no longer the 500 in the screencast).



**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).
