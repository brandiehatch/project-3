scribbleandsaph,1652516495,upcrep,0,False,1,"I moved about 6 months ago with my 2 cats. It was stressful for them but everything settled down after about 2 months. I should add the 4 year old has been on anxiety medication for about a year. The 2 have never been best friends but tolerated each other. 
The last month or so we have had several new people move into the street with outdoor cats. They are constantly fighting and spraying right outside my house, on the road and in the neighbours yard.

My guys just aren't coping. They both try to stick to me 24/7 and get jealous if I'm interacting with the other. It's at the point the 4 year old is hiding all the time,  pulling fur (she mostly stopped when she started meds), and is constantly unsettled. 
The 6 year old who is twice her size will attack her on sight, or me. He will destroy the curtains and hump everything constantly. I don't know how to keep them separated because whoever can't be right beside me freaks out plus the 4 year old has literal panic attacks if she's closed behind a door. She has always been that way.
I have feliway diffusers in all rooms, they are taking Zylkene, I try playtime but they're just not interested anymore probably because they are constantly on high alert. They have a catio I have been rotating them in when they want to be out there during the day. I know I will likely need to do a full reintroduction but again they both flip out and tear at doors or themselves when shut in a room.
There is no way I can halve the house either, and I am in a rental so can't go changing doors or anything. 
I plan on taking them to the vet as soon as I can afford it which will hopefully be in about 2 weeks. Both got a clean bill of health at the vet about 6 weeks ago aswell.  Other than the 4 year old having a bad heart murmer and a badly healed pelvis fracture from before I rescued her.
Both are spayed and neutered too.
I don't know what to do until the vet. We are all at breaking point.
I'm sure there is more I've forgotten to add too. There's nothing I can do about the cats outside either. I've been using cat deterrents and tried door knocking but it's not a nice area and I was just repeatedly threatened. The council and ranger says there's nothing they can or will do either.

We have another cat that's a bit younger, skittish and extremely submissive to him (although has gotten more confident). We've tried different litter box types and different clay litters. Wife has tried pellets at one point but he didn't like that either. He tends to scratch outside the box when he's done, mimicking covering it up. We've tried to correct him by taking his paws to the litter to cover up his stuff, to no avail.

We've pretty much begrudgingly accepted it even after taking him to the vet multiple times through the years with no issues. They said it's normal and fine. The only thing is we hate it, because we end up scooping after him at least two times a day to keep the fecal odor at bay.

I‚Äôm stumped as to what could have caused this sudden behavioral change since we hadn‚Äôt moved/no changes in the apartment or lifestyle/no introduction of new people/animals. 

I cleaned out her litter boxes with a non scented soap and filled one with non scented ordinary litter (the same type we have been using for years) and one with the Attract litter formula to see if that will work. So far, she‚Äôs been using the one with the attract litter in it but still only for peeing purposes.

about a week ago, the air conditioner in our studio broke and with it being spring, it‚Äôs been getting warmer, so this was obviously an issue. my landlord promised to replace it but hasn‚Äôt followed through yet, but i figured out that if i put a fan in the window for about an hour before i leave, it keeps our place cool until i get home. then, i just put it in the window again for a couple hours before we go to bed and it‚Äôs cool for the night. this went smoothly for the first day or so. neither twin was very interested in the window at all and didn‚Äôt realize it was open until the curtain fell and exposed the whole window. dawn realized she could escape through it and ever since, it‚Äôs been a problem. i can‚Äôt open the window at all anymore or she tries to get out, even with very close supervision. 

the first day, i decided to only leave the window open for a half an hour before work, and put her in the bathroom while i got ready. she started screaming and scratching the door so i went and sat with her and got ready in there, but it made no difference, she still screamed. so i closed the window. second day, i tried it again, giving her treats whenever she was calm and quiet while i got ready. this worked. after dinner i tried again, but i think she caught on to why we were in there and she started screaming again, even with me and treats in the bathroom with her. 

third day, i got the carrier out. it‚Äôs actually kennel for medium dogs that fits both twins nicely, we use it for travel. i put her in the kitchen area with me (out of sight of the window) while i cooked, her sister sat with us, it was fine. but the fourth day was basically an exact repeat of the second day. and finally last night, fifth day, i gave up and tried to open the window while she was asleep, just hoping she didn‚Äôt care anymore. nope, she woke up and immediately went for it.

i really just don‚Äôt know what to do. i‚Äôm not comfortable letting her outside because of the area we live in, and really just not comfortable with outside cats in general, + i don‚Äôt think she **needs** to go out or anything. she‚Äôs never cared about windows until‚Ä¶ right now. and for reference, fawn couldn‚Äôt care less about the window and hasn‚Äôt tried to escape at all.

They own a cat as well and after a few days of hissing, both cats ended up enjoying each others company and playing around, sleeping together... However it was clear that my cat was definitely the dominant one. 

I have now taken in their cat for two weeks. She's much more anxious than mine in new situations, so I've isolated her with all her belongings in a closed, quiet room. The rare times my cat has entered this room since, she's been eating straight out of the other cat's food bowl and leaving it stressed and anxious, so I'm starting the reintroductions very slowly. 

Now here's the problem, the new cat is getting slowly used to our cat's presence and is curious about the outside, but ours won't allow the new cat to visit the rest of the appartement, her territory. She becomes aggressive (which we've rarely seen before), so the new cat just runs back into the room all stressed.

I've also used the citrus deterrent spray, but that literally only keeps him away as long as the spray is still wet. Once it dries he's back at it. And that spray is AWFUL as it gets everywhere (including your nostrils and tongue) and lingers.

If I get up to go to the bathroom, or try to read to get to sleep, or go on my phone Hank wants me to get properly up. So he'll try any kind of behaviour to achieve this. He meows. He cries. He pretends he wants to go outside. And‚Äìand this is the problem‚Äìhe'll claw the couch.

I've tried a bunch of Jackson Galaxy solutions. Here they are, and why they haven't worked:

* **""Offer alternate scratching posts.""**¬†I do. There are two within immediate proximity to the couch, one of which he likes a lot. But it's not about scratching, because h*e never scratches the couch except to get my attention.*
* **""Reward alternate behaviour.""** I do. I do get up when he uses the scratching post near my bed, and pay attention to him if he climbs on the bed and comes to me.
* **""Cover up the couch with plastic protectors and blankets.""** I have. Now he goes to town on small strips of the couch that the plastic and blankets don't quite cover.
* **""Put him in another room.""** It's a studio apartment. There IS no other room.
* **""Redirect his attention.""** Because he's clawing the couch to get attention, this doesn't work. Even stirring in bed seems to reinforce the behaviour.
* **""Just ignore him.""**¬†I've been trying this for months (and the couch has absorbed a lot of damage in the process).¬†But he's smart. He remembers that he's gotten reactions for scratching the couch in the past, and he seems to take even the slightest movement as a sign that it's working.

**Is there anything other than discipline I can try now?** Because I kinda don't know what to do at this point. And on those early mornings, when I can't sleep, my nerves are frazzled, I have to work in 4 hours, and he won't stop, visions of using a spray bottle begin to dance in my head.

Unfortunately they forgot to get him vaccinated so i‚Äôll have to bring him to the vet next week for his first shot (i won‚Äôt pay anything since it‚Äôs their fault).

When he arrived at my place he immediately felt comfortable and it was honestly like he always lived here with me, he was very cuddly and friendly and he seemed to love his new home. 
But i rapidly started to notice a problem with his eyes (they were watery, always dirty even tho i clean them) and he was sneezing quite a lot. I contacted the association who gave me this sweet cat and explained what was happening, they told me to bring him to the vet which i did. The vet said it was probably just a cold or conjunctivitis so he gave him a shot of antibiotics and gave me little bags of powdered probiotics to put in his food for 6 days (he doesn‚Äôt like them haha). 

Another problem i noticed is that he won‚Äôt let me sleep at night. Whenever i go to bed, he starts to meow and run everywhere (especially on the bed). The first days were awful, and then i decided that i wasn‚Äôt gonna lack sleep my whole life. So i bought noise canceling earplugs and whenever he starts to jump on my bed i just put him in the living room and close my bedroom door.

A little context before I tell you what happened. She was meowing all night, as she often does, so I put her outside of my bedroom door. I didn't sleep well due to her howling and was annoyed when I woke up. This morning she bit me before I fed her, which she frequently does when I'm petting her before she's been fed in the morning. I've never reacted before to being bit other than saying ""ow."" So this is what happened this time: in the split second she bit my hand, in unhooking my hand from her teeth I pushed my hand towards her and said ""OW"" with annoyance/anger. It was a quick, impulsive reaction to being bit that happened in a split second. It wasn't super aggressive but I felt horrible about it and cried afterward. I have seriously feared harming my cat in any way because I've been abused before.

She gave me a look like ""huh?"" when it happened but didn't appear to be afraid of me. An hour after it happened, she was getting pets and purring. She's not avoiding me. She seems to be OK though I suppose we can never know.

But I think what I've done is bad and I hope never to repeat it. I also feel kind of flabbergasted by the situation because it happened as a quick reaction, and it feels like I wasn't really in control of my reaction. It felt like a defensive, impulsive reaction to physical harm though I know she didn't mean anything bad by it. I feel scared because if I'm capable of doing that, what else am I capable of doing? I want to work on my anger. Maybe I should avoid petting her before I've fed her in the morning though she is so so cute and it's hard to do.

We've had a good, loving relationship. I don't yell at her, I speak to her lovingly, feed her three times a day, play with her, give her plenty of treats/attention, and love petting her so much that sometimes I have a hard time leaving her alone. I've also had some difficulty with her, as she meows through the night and pees outside of the litter box when she's upset. I try to play with her during the daytime so she doesn't howl through the night but it still often happens. I also got one of those top covered litter boxes to reduce her peeing outside of it. It still happens.

Bf would play with them, give them treats, and was the only one feeding them their dinner (wet food). 

However things started to change once the female cat escaped for a night and hid under my porch. Boyfriend found her hiding between the siding and the frame. He and grabbed cat from the cramped porch for me. Because it was so confined and she was so skittery, he had to drag her out and wrap her tightly in a towel. She had no injuries, but she was scared after spending the night outside. She also became afraid of my boyfriend and began hiding and hissing at him from across the room. This frustrated him and at first he gave her space. But once he picked her up to put her in another room to eat her food (she is a piggy food stealer). She was scared, and scratched the top of his foot, leaving behind 3 long scratches that bled pretty badly. 

After this, anytime the cats hiss or do a behavior that he doesn't like he hisses at them and locks them in the bathroom. He does this as a way to train and punish them. The male cat still liked him during all of this. But last week, while the male was sitting in boyfriends lap, the bf stopped petting him to answer a text, the male slapped and scratched bf's face. There was no provocations from bf at all, or warning signs from the cat (tail flicks, raised heckles, growling, etc.) The male just scratched his face. Bf was angry and locked him in the bathroom for a few hours. When the cat was let out he growled, and bf hisses at him in return. 

Now the cats hide and growl at the bf whenever he is over. 

The cats are nothing but sweet and very cuddly to me. I've tried telling him to be patient and given them space. He has tried regaining their trust again, but he is frustrated at the sudden reset.¬† He wonders how many times he will have to reintroduce himself and regain their trust. 

We plan on moving in together soon, and he said he would never ask me to get rid of my chosen babies. But he doesn't want to interact with them anymore. I don't want them to be afraid and angry at each other. I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable in their own place. I want everyone to get along.

I adopted a stray male cat I found a year ago, he is now 2yo and one of the most well behaved cats you can imagine. He is sweet, cuddly and doesn‚Äôt cause any trouble, only problem is he is usually bored as I cant play much with him.

A couple weeks ago I found another male stray approx 8 months old. I took him to the vet and the original idea was to give him for adoption but finally decided to give him a chance so I neutered and took care of him. Thing is my house only has one place where I can really keep them separated so the new kitten got to stay on a small covered terrace. I did the proper introduction and they both seemed happy to see each other after the 2 weeks I kept them separated.

My resident cat at first hissed at him while smelling his odor in my hands and clothes but lately while they had visual but no physical contact he seemed super happy and anxious to play.

Problem begins when my older cat approaches the new kitty hisses and swats at him. He even dominates him and stole the places where my other cat usually is by swatting and hissing. My older cat is terrified as every time he tries to approach him the other one swats and hisses, sometimes even growls. I‚Äôve tried playing with both but the new one will hiss when the other approaches.

For some backstory, we used to have another cat who just kind of disappeared in 2017 and hasn't come back; we have no idea where she went. Before that, Bear used to be very sociable with her, they would fight sometimes but it was never anything serious, they were just playing. 

However, when I moved out to go to college at the start of 2020, my parents would send videos of him being violent without any explanation. I've since had experiences with him which are concerning: 

Someone will be patting him or playing with him, and without warning, he'll jump and go for the face with claws and teeth. It's resulted in both my parents and myself bleeding. The only warning signs we know to look out for are that his tail will start lashing, and his eyes will get very very big; there's no growling or hissing or fluffy tail or any other kind of ""screw off, man"" behaviour. 

I don't let him sit on my lap anymore because that's usually when he strikes. I think he has some kind of anxiety issues, too, because when my parents leave he's usually quite upset and he's stopped going to the toilet in his litterbox. 

I've asked for him to be taken to the vet on many occasions (I haven't done so myself because for  about11 months of the year I live in a different state), and the only report I've gotten back is ""he's fine"".

They should be potty trained and for the 2 weeks my sister had them, they only ‚Äûmissed‚Äú like 1-2 times in total. In our apartment they also behaved for the first 3 days with 0 incidents. They went to the litter box and everything was fine. 

Then suddenly one cat started to pee in other places. On the 4th day 2 times in the bed and once on the floor next to it. The day after she peed on the bed again. Twice. We decided to not let them in the bedroom for some days (we only have a limited supply of clean beddeng and dovets need some time to dry). It was fine then for a few days. She never peed in the living room. She also never peed in the office. Altough we only let them im there when we are nearby (not at night) since we have some expensive equipment in there and we still don trust them alone. 

But then, after those peaceful days it started again. First she peed on the toilet mat (about 50 cm from her litter box). She did that after i sat down in the living room and pet her. After like 10 minutes she went straight to the toilet mat and peed there. Fine. Its close so i didnt think much of it. But then a few hours later i let her in the office and she went straight on the small couch there and peed on that. First time and she was in there everyday with me for the last week for some hours and no incidents. A few hours after that we let her in the bedroom again (the cat liked to cuddle, sleep on your chest or lap). My fiance had to put her to the side for like 10 seconds to answer a call and who would have guessed. The cat started to pee on the bed again. 

What we already tried/do:
‚Ä¢placing the cats on the litter box multiple times a day and giving them treats when they pee
‚Ä¢buying lots of cat toys and playing alot with them. Really alot
‚Ä¢we clean the litter box about 2-3 times a day
‚Ä¢we are using feliway classic now
‚Ä¢we try to make sure that they always have enough food (we give them wet food once a day and we have a bowl of dryfood always filled up a bit -&gt; my sister only gave them dryfood with 0 problems) 

Our normal reaction to this is telling the cat ‚ÄûNein‚Äú (no) in a harscher tone and placing them on the toilet. People recommend pushing their nose into the pee and stuff like that but we really dont wanna do that. (But we starting to get desperate and frustrated with her). 

Is there anything we could be doing wrong? How should we handle that? I really wanna give the cats full access to the apartment (its not the biggest anyways so i dont wanna restrict rooms from them), but we also just cant change the bedding 2-4 times each day and struggle with cleaning couches and office chairs (i have a 1200‚Ç¨ ergonomic chair cause of my back problems and i would be really sad if a cat pees on that) 

For us it seems like the cat is only doing it when we are around and right after we deny her something (like lifting her off the kitchen counter with a ‚Äûnein!‚Äú or stoping her from scratching the bed. 

We are currently expanding their play opportunities. I bought alot of cat toys yesterday, ordered a bigger cattree, even bought supplies to create a wall parkour for them (one likes climbing on furniture alot so i guess she likes high places).

We are pet lovers in this house and have multiple fish tanks and lizard tanks. Surprisingly both cats like watching said fish tanks but have never attempted to reach in them or go for a swim so that's good. But the new kitten has an OBSESSION with one our big water dragons tank. Everytime he moves (not often) she flips, will run from the whole other side of the house to watch what he's doing! Problem is after watching for a few minutes she always ultimately jumps on top of his tank and lays down to watch him. I understand this may not seem bad as shes not trying to hurt him or anything, big BUT here, it's so dangerous! We not only have heat lamps that could easily burn her up there,  she's knocked them off before which could cause house fires, and when she gets older I don't know if his tank will be able to hold a 10-15 pound cat once she's grown. Also our lizard is a predator and any long appendage like a tail or paw he would definitely go for considering he's gone for our fingers a couple times. Our worst fear is coming home to his tank destroyed because the top caved in or a fire from the lamps. At this point we are debating even letting her ""watch"" him since it always turns to interaction.

His name is Goose and he‚Äôs a siamese long haired cat who we think is a little over a year old. We have three other cats: Jay (2M), Bodi (2M), and Sadie (4F), who mostly tolerate him. We have a large house shared with family and enough stimulation for all of them. He has other behavioral issues (skittish/scared, biting, swatting, aggressive play) that are currently getting better, but he still has a ways to go.

He wasn‚Äôt raised around other cats and we think this is the source of his main issues. His social skills are really poor, and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge a lot of social cues from other cats. 

(1) He doesn‚Äôt exactly know how to share space with another cat and he has a lot of energy that he takes out on the other cats which is causing them to stop coming near us. He basically claimed us and fended off all of our other cats and were sad that the others don‚Äôt see us as much. 

(2) He plays too aggressively. We know he wants to play but if I or another cat tries he bites and scratches way too hard. Our cats will be like yelping and he doesn‚Äôt let up. Ive tried being dramatic, not playing with him if he bites too hard, but he doesn‚Äôt give anyone a choice. He‚Äôll just pounce and latch on and we‚Äôre not sure why. He has enough space, but still will search out us and the cats to antagonize.

(3) This is the biggest issue, and I mentioned it previously, but he doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúno‚Äù from either us or cats. Jay will hiss and growl at him sometimes and Goose won‚Äôt back off. Bodi will cry out when playing and he won‚Äôt stop. The biggest issue we‚Äôre having is that we have feral cats in our neighborhood and a dog door we can‚Äôt close. We don‚Äôt mind him being outside but he doesn‚Äôt understand social cues from cats and keeps approaching these territorial feral cats who we know could and would severely harm/kill him.

Typing this as im nursing a bleeding leg, but this is an everyday thing for my husband and I. For context, we rescued her as a baby, approx. 5 months old when we took her to a vet. She was a feral cat, so I assumed with lots of love and play time at home, the play aggression would eventually go away. We have read books, blog posts online, and even this subreddit, to no avail.

She will attack with her paws and her mouth, and she goes for anything within her reach; a leg, arm, hand, foot, anything. We try to redirect with toys, but she just isnt interested. I walk backwards through my apartment, to keep an eye on her now. It seems to only be getting worse.

she is 3 years old. We try to make our living space as cat friendly as possible, with hiding places and things to get up high, like a counter or window sill. We have to keep the bedroom closed, because she will pee or poop on our bed, even though she is litter trained, and her box is clean.

She is obviously a very anxious cat, and I praise her when she is good, give her as much love as she will let me give, treats and wet food everyday. She is also very territorial, she gets mad when a cat is walking around outside.

We are just so tired of the wounds, we feel like we have tried everything. We love her and want this to end, because it is impacting my mental health, and we are scarred all over from the attacks.

He also meow alot when we dont give him attention. He sit in front of us and meow till we take him or play with him. He always following us and he wants us to take him in our arms. He can stay a very long time in our arms. He often wanna sleep in our bed too.

Sometimes the meow is very persistent and we dont always have the energy to play with him after a day at work. Sometime he also wake us up and it look like he wanna play.

first time posting here, so basically, I have two cats, one is a 1 yr old female, the other is a 6 month boy  


The boy (Willy) and the girl (Poppy) have gotten on very well ever since day one, she treated him like her own kitten (he was only 6 weeks old) and he took to her like his own mother.  


They've always played a little rough, but always were having fun with it, they spend most of the day together cuddling.  


Lately though, ever since he had his castration 2 weeks ago, hes been increasingly aggressive, and now when they wrestle, he has started biting her til she screams, and then continuing to bite her even then.  She runs away and he chases her to bite her again.  Now, they're still super friendly to each other, and shell often wrestle him back.  But I am concerned by his increasing inclination to bite her aggressively.  


Further, he's also began shredding entire rolls of toilet paper nightly the past 5 nights, which never happened even once before.  I can't figure out how to get him to stop.  Very frustrating.  


He also the past few days has suddenly had the zoomies an extra 2 or 3 hours a day... where is all this energy coming from?  


Anyways, I'd appreciate some tips, as I can't stand to watch him treat Poppy this way, she refuses to be aggressive back, she wont even hiss at him, she just runs away.

My son simba is a very playful extremely spoiled attention seeking brat, everyone loves him , 5 months ago he showed extreme aggression towards his sister (she always hisses at her brothers so we thought he was fed up and started fighting back) ,but then his attacks reached his brother (whom he loves so much)and finally his mother , it's very severe that we have to get involved physically to seperate him from them since water spray won't stop him . At that time my stray had her first heat period so we thought she was the problem(he never atacked her though ) ,thus we got her spayed quickly,then we noticed his urination difficulity and got him treated with some powder from vet ,it got cleared thankfully , YET his aggression remains .
He has been confined to my bedroom All throughout what i explained above, i just switch them up twice a day ao he won't get bored , it's been 5 months now ,i tried reintroducing them slowly , over snacks, play with his alone since he is very clingy to me , calming sprays ,and nothing worked, took him to 3 vet's all said it's mostly behaviour . 
I now have a new idea of seperating him from me and his brothers completely and put him in the opposite apartment ,problem is that apartment is empty and i'll only be with him to clean up for him and play with him for 20 minute max since i'm away most of the day, my mother scared me saying it'll make him more jealous  ( he always sleeps with me and is practically my shadow ) should i continou with this idea , seperating them in the same apartment is very difficult and exhasting for me and my family , nad if you have any ideas plz share them ,i can't give him up for adoption a really fear for him (he's too playful and destructive around the house , not many can tolerate raising him )

Ohh , i noticed a pattern in his attacks , he never attacks from the front , always from the back ,biting the neck first , one vet suggested testing him for progesterone hormone but we had to do it under full sedation, my brother refused saying he only suggested it cuz i kept begging him do do anything even if it was expensive ü•≤.

I have two ~8 month old kittens (littermates). They're super sweet and adorable. The one this post is about, Gremlin, is definitely more of a boundary tester-- she will jump on the counters as soon as I turn my back, scratch the couch and run away, etc. Nothing too bad but it may be relevant to my main question?

We've got a little bench by the front door that sits under a series of coat hooks. Gremlin will jump onto the bench, look up at the coat hooks, and meow plaintively and loudly several times. Then she'll try to climb the coats, which she knows she's not supposed to do because she'll run away when we go to redirect her. 

I ended up moving all the coats because it was so annoying constantly having to shoo her away, and she still sits there and meows loudly for several minutes at the coat hooks. She does this at all times of day, at least a dozen times a day. 

Any ideas what this could be about? I don't think it's an attention thing because she does it even after being played with and/or cuddled, and I've removed everything from the coat hooks so I can't imagine there's something up there she wants. I've even tried holding her up to the coat hooks so she can sniff around and she didn't seem interested. 

She does the same loud plaintive meow occasionally in other places but generally only will do one or two of them unless she's staring at those hooks.

Then, he does the thing he has done with all of his break away collars. He gets his lower mandible under it and tries to remove it.

This flea collar IS NOT a break away, I can't seem to find any that are. So after many very scary minutes fighting with a scared cat, I loosened it up and got him out. Very scary stuff. I shudder at the thought of that happening while I'm not at home and awake. I worry he'll break his jaw and suffer for hours before needing to be put down. The thought alone makes me misty eyed.

I know non break away collars are very dangerous. I've just moved into my new home and I don't have spots he can climb or get strung from so I assumed it was safe. After this incident I am not going to keep it on him.

Let‚Äôs call my cat Orange and his cat Brown. 

We‚Äôve noticed that any aggressiveness or behavioural issues between the two are entirely instigated by the female cat. Over the past month we‚Äôve slowly introduced them to some success. The last couple of weeks they were able to be left alone - they don‚Äôt cuddle or anything, and often growl if the other comes too close, but that‚Äôs the extent of the fighting. 

As of yesterday, they were sitting on opposite ends of the couch, and as it was bedtime I picked Orange up and was about to walk him over to our bedroom when Brown suddenly attacked. She ran around my feet in a frenzy trying to get at him, and myself not wanting to get hurt in the process set Orange down. She immediately proceeded to brawl with him, and chased him behind the couch. We separated them immediately and Brown was removed from sight when I put Orange in our bedroom (he sleeps in our bed, Brown isn‚Äôt cuddly at all).

taylorlove564,1649290486,ty06g3,0,False,1,"Hello all! About two months ago my partner and I adopted a stray cat (Lilith) and the introductions to our resident cats has not been going super well. 

To preface, the vet estimate that she is about 5 years old and prior to bringing Lilith home I knew she was at least a little territorial. She was a stray in my mother in law‚Äôs apartment complex and I have seen her get a little sassy with the other strays, including one cat we assume is her sibling. However, she seemed to be able to be in their presence without outright attacking them. What I mean by this is she would clearly be agitated by the other cats on occasion, and she would smack them around a little bit. There was at least one instance where I heard a cat fight break out while I was inside, and when I came out she was fighting with one specific cat, but as far as I know she didn‚Äôt fight with most of the other cats. 

I will admit that the initial introduction did not go great because I rushed it. While I kept her separated from the other two from day one using a pet gate, I allowed them all to see each other for the first two days, which in hindsight was a mistake. I had successfully introduced three cats prior to this and thought it would be just as easy, but boy was I wrong. 

Things I have tried include:

* Switching bedding. My male cat has a specific pillow he sleeps on, so I would switch their beds for a few days at a time. Lilith would sleep on the pillow without any problems, but my male cat would not go anywhere near her bed.
* Treats. This is where we have seen the most improvement. Lilith is a fiend for treats and will do just fine around the other cats if there are treats involved. She doesn‚Äôt pay any attention to them and will allow them to get pretty close to her. Honestly, I‚Äôm part of the problem here because I get *very* anxious whenever they get close to each other. I‚Äôm worried about a cat fight breaking out and setting us back after we have made such little progress. We bought a leash and harness for Lilith and will put her in that so we can quickly pull her away if things start to go bad. Recently I wanted to see what she would do off leash - because I genuinely believe this cat is smart enough to not try anything when she knows she‚Äôs on the leash - and the encounters went well **when there were treats involved.** She focuses on treats and nothing else during these sessions, and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good thing or a bad thing.  
* Play. She does alright when we‚Äôre playing. They all love this broken string toy I have (tell me why they play with it more now that they broke it lol), but Lilith will sometimes try to lunge at the other cats. So far, I have only felt comfortable enough to play through the gate or through the door because I don‚Äôt trust her enough. 
* Moving living spaces. Recently we started rotating the cats just about every night. One night Lilith will have access to the entire house and the other two will sleep with us, and then we will flip the next night. I honestly don‚Äôt know if this is doing anything to get them used to each other, but I felt like I wasn‚Äôt giving Lilith enough attention throughout the day. They all sleep in the same spots (cat tree in the living room, cat tree in the bedroom, under the bed, etc.). Also, we will swap cats in the office, but it is a little harder to do this because our male cat will hop the gate if he wants to. Just yesterday he jumped in without realizing Lilith was in there, and there was chasing and hissing on Lilith‚Äôs part. My partner acted very quickly and sprayed her with a spray bottle which stopped her immediately. Also, sidenote, we do not spray any of the cats *unless* there is a fight. 
* Feeding together. I try to feed all three of them near each other every morning and night. My resident female cat will not approach the gate if she can see Lilith, which makes things a little difficult. Our male cat is sweet, dumb, and so innocent. He has no problems eating with Lilith, but she has started to press her face to the gate and slowly paw at him after she‚Äôs done eating. He gets uncomfortable but will continue eating most of the time. 

I‚Äôm trying to create as much positive association as I can, but there have been setbacks:

* Our male cat, ever the curious, sweet, and dumb boy that he is, got very close to the gate. It was late at night, so we were in bed and not paying attention, and we had not had a fight up until this point, so Lilith had access to her room, plus the hallway leading up to the pet gate. It had not been a problem prior, so we were loosening the restrictions a little bit, but Lilith must have lunged at him through the gate. It happened so fast and by the time we were up, it was over. I‚Äôm not sure she actually got him, but there was yowling and hissing. So, after this she was allowed in the hallway up until it was time for bed, and we kept a better eye on the gate just in case one of the other cats got close.
* Lilith has taken to squeezing through the gate, and one time she got out while my partner and I were not paying attention and got my male cat while he was eating dinner. I had been in the kitchen, so I did not get to see what happened, but he took off and Lilith was just standing in the hallway with little tuffs of her fur all over the place. My male cat is a sweet boy and I do not think he started it or really fought back, but I‚Äôm not sure she would just lose fur for no reason. 
* The day after this I tried to let them see each other while I held Lilith, but she started to get very antsy. I tried to reposition her, so I had a better hold of her as I was leaving the room and she freaked out, yowled, and scratched and bit my face. This was 100% my fault. I put her in a stressful situation without realizing it and made it worse when I tried to move her. While no cats were harmed, this moment was extremely discouraging for me, to the point that I considered rehoming her right then and there. Although I have had several cats, I am very afraid of them, so it was a terrifying moment that I have not 100% gotten over. Prior to this I had no fear of her because she is the sweetest cat when she is around people. So, while this may not be a setback for the cats, it was a setback for me.
* One night when Lilith was supposed to be in the main part of the house and the other two in our bedroom, we accidentally left the door open as we came back in and she followed us. When we realized they were all in the same room, she was in our male cat‚Äôs face, but nothing really happened. Both were clearly uncomfortable, and he was keeping perfectly still. As we approached, he ran away without her chasing, so I‚Äôm not sure if I can count this as a win or lose. 

These are the only major incidents that come to mind, but I am a worried that she is not going to be a good fit for our home. Most of these setbacks involve my male cat, but I know the long-term problem is going to be between Lilith and my resident female cat. Both cats are very confident and most times it is on sight for Lilith. If my resident female cat walks by, Lilith is flattening herself and preparing to lunge. She doesn‚Äôt do this nearly as often with my male cat. 

Again, she is so incredibly sweet with people, and I believe she would do great as an only pet. However, it is very important to me that I get her integrated into our home. She helped me through one of the worst times in my entire life, and while I‚Äôm determined to help her with getting along with our two resident cats, I understand this might not be the best environment for her and I will ultimately do what is best for all three of them. 

I would appreciate any help, advice, or comments anyone has!",CatTraining,New cat not getting along with resident cats

we took my mama cat (1 year and 4 months old) to the vet with her kitten (11 weeks old). Mama cat had to get her yearly shot + shower and shave. Kitten had to get his first vaccine. 

Kitten was fine on the ride back home but suddenly started showing aggressiveness towards the mama cat at home. The kitten gets in a defensive position everytime he sees his mom (arched back, turning to the side hair standing, hissing etc I can send a pic through DMs if that‚Äôs helpful to anyone) Mama cat is confused and doesn‚Äôt understand why her son is getting defensive, she tries to approach, he freaks out, full on fight. The fight is very aggressive. They hiss and physically scratch either. My mama cat has scratches all over her and broke 2 nails in half. 

The first time it happened was on my sister‚Äôs bed. My cousin was staying over for a few nights and when mama cat went into the room to check up on her kitten he freaked out. With all the yelling and hissing my cousin started yelling and ran out of the room. Mama cat got scared and attacked my cousin very badly. After separating the kitten and it‚Äôs mama they were both fine. Mama wasn‚Äôt scared of my cousin then and even got on her lap at breakfast.

I didn‚Äôt know this would happen so i called the vet and he told me to keep them separated in different rooms. So i did but at at 6:30 PM yesterday the kitten somehow left the room when it‚Äôs supposed to be closed. My sister and i were both napping when we woke up to hissing sounds from the kitten. I tried to separate the kitten by carrying him (which i now know was wrong) mama cat freaks out and starts attacking me. Kitten was attacking my hand while the mama cat got my ankles so in a moment of fear i dropped the kitten in the living room. 

I don‚Äôt know when it happened but there poop from the kitten all over the floor. He went under the sofa and the cats starting attacking each other under there. I couldn‚Äôt get to them and had no idea how to separate them so i called the vet. He told me to spray water on the cats (i could only get to the kitten and everytime i sprayed water he would just freak out more and attack). All my attempts failed until the mama cat stepped a few feet away from the hissing kitten. She was shivering and absolutely terrified. I tried luring her into my room with treats and food but she was too scared to do anything. She went to another room on her own so i locked the door and kept her there until i could dry the kitten, put him in his room and clean and disinfect the poop from the floor. 

I couldn‚Äôt keep the kitten there any longer as i had no guarantee it wouldn‚Äôt leave the room again. My mama cat can open my rooms door if it‚Äôs not locked. I tried locking her in there but i think she got scared because her meows sounded very scary and i couldn‚Äôt bear to hear them. The kitten stayed in my sisters room but the door is kind of loose so it doesn‚Äôt close all the way and can easily be opened by Mama cat. 

I called my aunt and asked her if she could take the kitten for a few days. The mama cat spent around 10 month of her life there + all of february. The kitten spent all of february there as well so it wasn‚Äôt a foreign environment. The kitten seems to be doing well and is adjusting easily to his new environment. 

Mama cat is now scared of my cousin. Idk what happened but she was fine all day today until my cousin tried to pet her and she hissed at her. My cat almost never hisses so I got scared. Now mama cat stares down my cousin everytime she sees her. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs scared or planning to attack but either way i‚Äôm keeping them separated.

i have two cats. both spayed/neutered ‚Äî a 5 year old male and a 2 year old female. i adopted her in the beginning of the pandemic since a second cat always was a desire of mine and they soon became really good friends. back then, i lived with my mother and the female kitten was very attached to her. personality wise, the male cat is more of a loner ‚Äî he hangs in the same room i'm normally in but is not very touchy-feely or talkative. he normally sleeps by himself on the couch; while the female cat is very very needy and is pretty much attached to me at the hip. recently (around november/2021) mom moved to another continent and i've been living on my own with just the two of them. i often have friends over and the cats are very sociable and playful with them. they each have their own litter box, which i clean daily and replace completely weekly. 

and then something started happening around february that's been absolutely driving me mad: the female cat's been peeing on my bed whenever i go out for long periods of time. whether it's a date, a one-day trip or even my regular 9 to 5 job, if she's left by herself with her brother, she'll often pee on my bed.

i took her to the vet after the 4th or 5th time, and we did a whole bunch of exams (xrays, bloodwork, ultrasounds) to see if her problem was kidney-related but they all came out saying she was healthy as a horse. the vet recommended a phytotherapic medicine and that worked for a while ‚Äî until eventually she started peeing on my bed again (like once every 4 or 5 days). the vet then recommended the pheromone diffuser feliway. i've been using it for about a week now and it's been good. but then, this weekend, i had a two-day trip to another state and had a friend over taking care of the cats for me. and of course, she peed the bed again. i returned home sunday and today went to work, and when i got back from work, she had peed again. the vet said maybe we should try putting her on a low dosage of prozac because it's clear it's an emotional/behavioral issue rather than an physiological one. to be honest, i'm still hoping there's a solution other than literal prescription drugs.

it's been very emotionally exhausting for me dealing with this because sometimes i all want to do is lay in bed after a hard day and i simply can't because i have to wash all the sheets/duvet/covers

Though I have had roommates with cats before, I now live alone and this is my first time caring for a cat (had dogs growing up). Aside from some minor medical issues that have popped up it's been going great so far, though one particularly annoying thing Riku keeps doing is waking me up around 4:30am every morning demanding food. If I ignore him he will start to knock things off the shelves, nibble on my feet, or recently has begun to chew on the blinds, in an effort to stir me out of bed. If I put him outside my bedroom he just starts to do the same thing throughout the rest of my apartment and I end up staying awake anyway listening to him causing destruction.

Currently I feed him wet food at 7am and 6pm everyday and in between he gets a little bit of dry food in a puzzle feeder that he nibbles on during the day, along with treats now and again. I also give him a small broth packet before I go to bed (the Tiki cat ones that are 13 calories) usually around 10:30pm. He was very underweight when I adopted him and didn't eat for a few days, so my focus for the first few months has been to just get him to gain weight and restore his appetite, but now that he has I want to get more rigid with how much/when I am feeding him. I have a suspicion that one of the reasons he's waking me up so early is because I have gotten him accustomed to more frequent feedings and waiting between the last thing I give him and 7am is too long for him.

So my questions are:

* Are my feeding times too far apart? Is my feeding schedule too erratic?
* Would it help if I put out some food in his puzzle feeder overnight as well as during the day? Would this be feeding him too much? I usually put around 1/4 cup of dry food in the puzzle feeder.

I have a 22 lbs cockapoo that will be 2 in June. I picked the breed, in part, because they are good with cats and my family is stocked full of them.  He doesn't have a mean bone in his body and had spent ample time around my parents cats before I brought this kitten home at the very beginning of March.

I initially kept them seperate for about 3 days but once it was clear they are unphased by each other we moved on to supervised time together. 

Perhaps it's because all the cats in my life have had access to the outdoors prior to Stringer (the kitten). But this kitten is proving more work than Omar was as a puppy! He has been nicknamed the Terrorist by my cousin for his habit of making demands and then taking action if they aren't met.

Don't get me wrong. He is social, vocal, a loud purrer and the ultimate little spoon. 

But his hunting instincts are through the roof and when he gets the zoomies that shit comes out hard. Omar has now had two vet visits after the cat got too wound up and twacked Omar with claws out. Last night he did the butt wiggle and then attempted to pounce on Omar (who was on my lap). 

On the whole, he wants to be friends with the dog and cuddle sessions were frequent the past couple weeks (always initiated by the cat). But understandably, the dog is very skeptical after this 2nd attack (and pretty miserable at the moment).

My GF recently brought her 2 cats in to my place where I have 1 cat of my own. 

# Cats

**Lola** is my own female cat, she's about 10 months old and came from an animal shelter. She wasn't very keen to humans at first but I gave her time and she warmed up nicely. She's your typical young cat, curious and playful. Likes to sit near you but rarely on your lap.

My GF has 2 cats.

**Gini** is 4 years old, **Pepsi** is 1.5 year old. Both are females, they love each other yet are definitely opposites of each other. Gini is a super friendly and calm cat, she never hisses or bats to any new cat or human. Pepsi is a loud cat, quite big too and in my eyes she's quite dominant and needy. 

# Introduction Process

In terms of how to introduce each other, we've mostly followed what Jackson Galaxy mentioned in one of his videos.   
Lola gets a separate part of the apartment to be in peace with. Separate litter box, food, water, places to relax, etc  
Pepsi + Gini get the same together, since they need no introduction to each other.

We give them food at the same (closed) door, we also swap them out back and forth so they get used to the other smells. We also already brought in Lola with Gini and played with both of them to avoid the ""mexican standoff"", this played out nicely with no aggression present. This is day 2/3 of the introduction already, so perhaps we are going too fast and it doesn't hurt to just stick with swapping/feeding at closed door part?

Lola and Gini are OK with each other from anything 1m+ apart. Lola keeps approaching Gini with ears up/no nervous tail wagging when we're not playing. I assume she's just her normal curious self then since I see no signs of aggression.

It's only when Lola gets really close (&lt; 30cm), that she herself does a hiss and even bats with her paw if we would let her. We don't, as soon as she does this we use a laser pointer or make some noise of our own to distract her, which works. This might be a bad thing though, like reinforcing hissing -&gt; play time? Gini btw doesn't care, she just sits there calmly with eyes closed and doesn't retaliate at all.

For Lola and Pepsi it's much worse. Lola is not as approachy and seemingly sits calm wherever she is. but Pepsi stalks her from a distance, and would jump on her + hiss + use paws (+ claws?) if we didn't break her up immediately. We tried playing with both to distract them, but Pepsi doesn't really play and mainly watches Lola which involves in a hiss/paw swapping if Lola accidentally plays too close.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I hear from my Great, she didn‚Äôt play much, and really her only hobby was knocking things off tables. Other than that she just loved sitting on laps and purring.

As it is now, Richard has full reign over the basement. He‚Äôs allowed upstairs, but only for short trips. I had no idea how to acclimate him and Lolly as I didn‚Äôt want to deprive him of his space, and I only have three rooms to do so. He also has terrible separation anxiety and as it is I basically live alone, so no one can keep him company while I tend to the new cat. Thus, the horror story.

Despite all this, I wanted to go through the whole acclimation process, but my mom encouraged me against my better judgement to just allow Richard to sniff Lolly through the carrier once we brought her home. I think she just wanted to rush the process so she didn‚Äôt have to be involved with it, possibly having to take Richard upstairs, because she then proceeded to push me to open the carrier and I just did it reluctantly, again, against my better judgment. (My mom has BPD moods, and she was currently in one, and I didn‚Äôt want to see the fallout of disobedience.)

Richard has never hissed once before in his life, but he hissed twice at Lolly. I had no idea he was territorial; he‚Äôs always only been skittish. My mom took him, a litterbox and a food bowl upstairs for ‚Äúthe time being,‚Äù but my boyfriend and I went out for snacks after this, and by the time I got home she wanted him back downstairs. 

So, now I‚Äôm going through with the original plan I told my mom I wanted to do. Lolly is being kept in my room with food, water and a litterbox, while Richard has full reign over the living area and spare room. But Richard is a noisy noisy fella, and he has separation anxiety.

I think Lolly has accepted his existence, if not a little fearful of it, but Richard seems oblivious to her being in there now. He‚Äôs been meowing and scratching at my door all night and I feel terrible. He‚Äôs my baby, and I don‚Äôt want to neglect him while trying to get Lolly used to her new space, but I can‚Äôt spend time with them both at the same time. There‚Äôs only one of me, and my mom‚Äôs made it clear she‚Äôs not helping. 

I feel terrible every time I hear him at my door, but I can‚Äôt spend more than a few minutes out of my room without worrying Lolly is scared and alone in her new surroundings. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll be able to finish introducing them without neglecting either of them, or if Richard will ever even get along with her.

TL;DR My cat hissed at my new cat when my mom pushed me to rush their introduction, and now I‚Äôm going through the standard acclimation process I‚Äôd planned. But my first cat has separation anxiety and is very vocal and keeps meowing at my door because he‚Äôs used to free reign over the space and he doesn‚Äôt want to be alone. I don‚Äôt want to neglect either of them during the process but there‚Äôs only one of me. I‚Äôm also afraid because their first introduction was botched they won‚Äôt ever get along.",CatTraining,My cat hates my new cat and I only have a 3-room space to introduce them.

My boys always been a chatty cat. Whenever he gets up, jumps, jumps on you, stretches.. anything.. even after he pisses sometimes he chirps a little. It's just always been his thing.   


The downside to it is his always been demanding for food. When I fed him dry food/wet mix it was mostly under control because he would only complain when his bowl was empty and his bowl was only empty when I got home from work (I fed him once a day).   


Two things have changed this, firstly working from home. I'm home all day 2 days a week now due to covid restrictions with my work and this has completely screwed up his food routine. His bowl will be empty by morning (from last nights food) and he will begin his demands from the start of the day. Second his had teeth issues and have been fixed but he can't have dry food anymore as it just falls out of his mouth. His front left part of his gum is essentially missing so he can't chew on that side and it keeps falling out everywhere and even if he does get it down my vet says he may not due it enough to swallow properly.  


So I'm in a predicament. I only feed him wet food and I'm home twice a week (excusing weekends when I am only really home on Sundays) and I can't figure out for the life of me how to fix his demands.   


I've tried ignoring him. It can last 4-5 hours when I do this and then when I do feed him when his quiet I think he associates the 4-5 hours of demanding with for the food as a reward. I've tried rewarding him for when his quiet, I did this for weeks and I got nothing from it.

- Sniffing outside of the door/getting treats on either side of the door.  
  
- Putting a baby gate for interactions through that as opposed to direct contact with supervision.

my boyfriends previous place didnt allow animals but this one does so we decided to bring his two cats (9yo female gizmo and her mother, 10yo female nicky). we had a feeling that it would obviously take a bit, especially with nicky. gizmo is known to be generally cuddly and nice, only really getting mad when you stop petting her or pet her wrong. nicky is known to be more on the mean side, only really liking my boyfriend, his mom, stepbrother, and me but recently shes been getting better.

so, we were more worried for nicky not getting along with mowgli but its turned the other way.

at first, both the girls didnt like mowgli, hissing and growling. over the first 4 or 5 days, nicky has chilled out tremondously with him.they dont cuddle or anything she doesnt growl or hiss at him anymore. keep in mind, nicky barely even likes gizmo, and she birthed gizmo.

but, gizmo absolutely hates mowgli. and mowgli, he only wants to be friends. he has never retaliated to her, never growled or hissed at either of them.

it is to the point where we have to lock mowgli in our room with us at night or we wake up every hour to gizmo just attacking him. hes got scratches on his face and neck, scabs on his ears.

mowgli does NOT initiate. gizmo does. she will sit at the top of the stairs and if hes downstairs, he cant go up because he knows the second he gets close enough, shes pouncing on him.

none of them are declawed, we do no believe in that, but all of them are fixed.

gizmo just gets pissed the second mowgli is within eyesight. there has been a few rare occasions where she tolerates him and there has been times he cautiously tries to walk up to her but it always ends when him getting attacked.

its been nearly a month. we have tried playing with them together, feeding them near each other (neither nicky or gizmo is food aggresive with him, the girls have different dry food than him and they all eat each others with no problems but we do give them all wet food), we have tried cat nip and cat sensort videos but nothing is working. 

i love nicky and i love gizmo. but mowgli is MY cat. hes my big baby, hes a really big mamas boy he loves me. he cant sit with me on the couch or be comfortable anymore unless gizmo is out of sight completely. it hasnt affected him too bad, hes just beaten up and he tucks his tail when he sees her but his demeanor with me has not changed. he is just scared. but its damaging my feelings towards gizmo. i am protective of my cat, he is very sweet and i love him a lot, so i get angry with her when she attacks him and hurts him.

SwGustav,1648242711,tnz85q,0,False,1,"Hello, I have two female cats, let's call them M (~3 years old) and S (~2 years old). They got attached to each other within a couple days when they met, and used to be best pals for 1.5 years, and at most M attacked S for a brief moment when there was another cat outside the window (redirected aggression). But last week out of nowhere M attacked S and now treats her basically as a foreigner, and there's no improvement. I didn't take either of them to vet or anything like it, it happened out of nowhere, they were just sitting in the same room, there wasn't even a cat in the window to trigger it. 

M would chase S and fight her pretty badly for some days. It marginally improved since then where it's mostly stare contests and hissing from M (no flat ears), but M is still very wary of S and I think still would fight if opportunity presents itself, and so S can only sit in my room and is quite terrified of M. There was a couple moments where M sniffed her and they were near each other without fighting, but M would still snap again a few hours later. She doesn't react to her scent, I tried the shirt thing, but maybe there's some weird smell on S? (no idea out of where though)

They are both spayed since 6 months ago and handled it well, though I think M has ovarian remnant syndrome - she's displayed heat symptoms at times, but not right now. So idk if it's hormonal, could it be?

I'm at loss of what to do honestly. I try to separate the cats and let them have some visual contact but I don't think it's gonna get better, do I wait it out? I ordered some sort of catnip to try and remove stress from M since she sometimes goes around the rooms wagging tail aggressively (territorial behavior?).

Marty, my other cat, has been less of a fan. after escaping through a faulty window screen he has been yowling and meowing all day and night and trying to sprint out the door when either I or my roommate get home. 
he was never this intent on getting outside in any of my other living situations, likely due to the surplus of windows. I have tried everything from intense play sessions, to cat tv while I'm at work, to buying new feeding enrichment but nothing satiates his need for the great outdoors. 
after taking weeks to screen in my sunken back patio area with zip ties and aluminum window mesh and cat proofing it to the best of my ability, Marty (already leash trained, but doesn't really go outside unless it's in a small enclosed space) was able to go outside in a harness and lead. he sniffed around a bunch and stood on the patio rail to peak up at the ground level. he kept insisting to be held and sniff the outside and then would go back to the railing. he went and yelled at the door to go back inside but when I opened it he didn't go back in. I would close it, let him hang out a bit more, and then the process would repeat. now I have to go back inside because it's getting incredibly cold and a little darker and I don't want to risk something happening and me not being able to find him. he will not stop screaming at the door. even when we were outside he seemed agitated that he wasn't able to escape again.

evileddie666,1648227988,tnraas,0,False,1," I have 3 cats, ages 12, 6, and 7months

The older 2 cats have never sprayed in their lives. We got the new kitten 5 months ago and there were no problems and he was neutered a month ago. All 3 cats are neutered.

2 Weeks ago each of the 2 older cats started spraying at least once a day around the house and I have no idea what has set them off. The kitten has never sprayed.

We have 3 litter boxes, one on each floor of the house, several scratching posts and kitty condos. I've been cleaning the spray spots by removing any urine and then applying a urine enzyme cleaner and then shampooing the carpet. I even moved the litter box over to where they sprayed a couple of times.

I've actually seen both cats spraying but a few of the spots just look like puddles on the carpet. All 3 cats have had recent vet appointments and the older 12-year-old had blood and urine tests and is in great health.

The vet suggested a phermome so I got 2 of those feliway phermone plug ins but they don't seem to do anything.

I don't know why they have started this. Every time I superclean a sprayed area....they pick a new spot the next day.

We have a small caged area where we let them go outside now that it's spring and I think maybe they saw or smelt another outside cat so I have restricted them to just the house for now (just a theory).

I might get 1 or 2 more litter boxes and I've had to close a few bedrooms doors to keep them out of the kids rooms.

I‚Äôm only really allowed to enter my bed when she‚Äôs ready to sleep. I try playing with her and giving her multiple laser and motorized toys however she is still pretty aggressive when no one is around me or if i‚Äôm in bed. 

A few nights ago she was asleep on her bed next to me and she seemed peaceful so I fell asleep. It is unlike her to attack me when i am in a deep sleep but this night i felt something on my face in my sleep and I knew it was her paws and my eye hurt. I later find out that she has scratched my face and left a scar that I needed stitches for. I am now afraid to sleep with her in my room but she doesn‚Äôt attack anyone else but I know she loves me a lot (i think or is possessive of me). It is also important to note the only difference that night was that she was in my room w a box that had catnip in it. I think that maybe she got into it in the middle of the night and as my door was closed she attacked me in a fit of cat zoomies. Though it is unlike her to attack me in my sleep it isnt unlike her to attack me in general.

EnvironmentNo7996,1647781597,tiknod,0,False,1,"Hello,

I need some help. I feel lost with this issue and nothing makes since. 
I have 2 sibling cats and they are about 3 years old. My male cat had bladder stones so we took him to the vet to get them removed and get a PU surgery. While he was recovering I separated the cats for 2 weeks (until the cone and his stitches were removed). I tried reintroducing them but I noticed straight away our female cat did not recognize him. 

I looked online and found out this is common. I've tried some of the suggestions, like feeding them both at the same time on either side of a door and try to slowly reintroduce them during their feeding time. I have been doing this for a little over 3 weeks with no improvement.

They eat on either side of the door at the same time just fine but as soon as I open the door our female cat gets aggressive and starts hissing and is ready to attack. I just don't understand how long this needs to take and what I am doing wrong, because I haven't seen any improvement since we started.

I was thinking about putting a light coat of chicken broth or vanilla extract on both of the cats to help get rid of their scents but I just don't know if thats a good idea. Any help with this situation is greatly appreciated.",CatTraining,Non-recognition aggression

My mom was screaming at me last night because I‚Äôm just frustrated but don‚Äôt want to shut my lizard alone in a room.

My cat is about 13-15, I‚Äôve had her for the last 6-ish years, according to the landlady of the complex I lived at she‚Äôd been abandoned there like 9 years prior so I‚Äôm not super confident on her age. She used to be predominantly both outdoor/indoor but then after a $1000 vet bill from an infection after a cat fight 3 or 4 years ago I relocated her to an exclusively indoor cat. It was fine, we didn‚Äôt have any problems except she will always pee on shower rugs, I think it‚Äôs the texture but it‚Äôs been consistent behavior, I‚Äôve never been able to get her to stop. I moved to a new place, mUch smaller, didn‚Äôt have any problems (other than shower mats so I just get hard bamboo ones) and this year I‚Äôve moved to another place. A huge old victorian, significantly bigger than the last, more space for her, however there are 3 other cats in the house. Two of the other cats are about 1yr old, more social, more comfortable around each other, and one 17 year old that hisses but barely leaves her bed (still more socialized than my cat &amp; comfortable with the kittens) which led my cat (who is kind of a runt, a small framed chunker if you will) to mostly staying in my room. After 6-ish months at this place she finally started leaving the room and exploring the house, it was super exciting we were all stoked she wanted to explore, still skittish of the other cats and prone to getting in hissing matches and cornering each other, but it didn‚Äôt stop her from exploring. However after a few weeks-months of this when we thought she was getting better and a little less fearful with the other cats she started peeing on one of my housemates shoes, cOnstantly (like expensive Italian shoes or something), then pooping on a shower mat downstairs (I‚Äôd warned before moving in that she doesn‚Äôt get along with shower mats but I digress), then started pooping on a door mat and a piano rug and now it‚Äôs every single time she gets out she will poop/pee in one or two of these places at night (mostly the piano rug which we literally cannot move without physical aid bc the piano is so heavy). So to avoid upsetting my housemates any further because she was the only cat causing problems I had to start shutting her in my room &amp; blocking her off from the house, trust me, I felt awful about this but she was out of control. And tonight, she peed on a pile of my clothes, on my arm chair and a pillow she‚Äôs used to sleep on for 5 years. I have no idea how to train her out of this, she doesn‚Äôt seem to have any health issues. She eats well, she drinks well, a little chunky but that‚Äôs mostly just her metabolism, no signs of a UTI and I have a whole second closet dedicated as her litter box room that I clean at least weekly if not more.

She's taken to peeing in the corners, by the front door and the garage door, about 4-5 ft from her litterbox.  She'll poop right outside her box, middle of the hallway, about 1-2 ft from a litter box.  The weird part is that she'll pee in the box one day, and decide she's gonna pee in the corner the next.  Her poop habits are similar, we'll find poop in a box and then poop on the floor.

I've read all the tips and have tried all of them.  We have two cats, and currently have four litter boxes, three of them just for this demon spawn.

TiredMamaZ,1647402765,tf8nar,0,False,1,"I am the adopted mom to a cat that we got from the humane society on February 18th. She is a domestic medium-haired cat, about a year old, and we were told that she had been at the shelter for about 3 weeks when we brought her home. She had also just gotten spayed. At the shelter, she seemed to be totally fine. She didn't hiss at anybody or do anything that would have given us any idea at her level of stress and anxiety. 

As soon as we brought her home, we put her in our guest room, giving her a small area to get used to where it was a little bit quieter. We have three kids, aged 14, 12, and 10. They are very good with animals and we're very respectful that we wanted to get Sylvie acclimated to the house and to the adults first, since we had no history on her. We have all been giving her space, trying not to make too much eye contact, etc. The kids haven't even pet her yet, and I spent the first three weeks just sitting quietly in the guest room and working so she would get used to me.

Since we brought her home, she has been constantly hissing at us whenever we come anywhere near her, and she refuses to come out from underneath furniture unless she forgets we're in the room. She's not interested in treats (we've tried a ton, including tuna and meat) nor is she interested in playing with anyone or anything. She also doesn't seem to respond whatsoever to catnip, toys, or Feliway. She started out hiding under the bed in the guest room, so we first tried to block off under the bed. She literally tore and shoved and moved everything so she could get back under it. We then propped up the mattress so that she could see us from between the slats, but still had the protection of being technically under the bed. She was okay there for a while, until she started getting more curious and exploring upstairs. We were so thrilled to see her exploring.

The kids left on a Spring Break trip last week and the house has been quiet. While exploring, she found our master closet upstairs and she has now parked herself in a tiny space deep underneath our dresser in the closet and she (still) hisses and swats at us every single time we come near the dresser. Last night, we went to bed and found that she had peed and pooped all over our bed. We immediately cleaned it up and replaced the sheets, and thank goodness our waterproof mattress cover was on, so we made sure to wash everything thoroughly. 

My husband got home from work today, and she had done it again. I don't know what to do, but I'm very worried that she seems to be getting much worse in her behavioral issues rather than any better. The last two days are the first time we have had litterbox issues with her, and she just got a clean bill of health from the vet (who was zero help). She is our only cat, and I am somebody who has had cats in the past, but I've never had a cat who struggled so hard to adjust and who was so aggressive. I don't think she's had any socialization at all, and I'm despairing that she'll adjust before my husband goes crazy because she keeps using our bed as a toilet.

The entire time that the vet was examining her, she was rubbing up against me, letting me and the vet tech pet her, and never hissed even once.

coolcat55555,1647386274,tf39yw,0,False,1,"Hi, I am looking for advice on how to keep my kitten off the counter. 

For context, we adopted two kittens, one male, and one female, that are around five months old two weeks ago. They've settled in great and are happy, purring, and cuddly, so I don't think it is a comfort issue. They didn't seem to be going on the counter previously, but recently discovered it and we obviously don't want them up there, both for sanitary reasons, and for their own safety. We tried aluminum foil and put down double-sided sticky tape, as well as lemon-scented spray. We also say a sharp ""no"" and pick them up and move them to their cat tree whenever we see them on it.

The female kitten has pretty much learned and while she still puts her paws up to test it out, she doesn't fully jump on anymore. The male kitten however is going up there all the time, nothing seems to bother him and we don't know how to get him to stop. When we see him do it we obviously move him off it, but he's doing it when we're not in the room (we know he is because we have a camera set up in the kitchen) and obviously we can't intervene then. Would love any advice from anyone who has managed to keep their cats off their counters!",CatTraining,Cat keeps jumping on counters!

She used to be an outdoor, countryside cat for those 4 years and then she spent 2 months in a foster's house before I got her. People that she stayed with said she adapted well to being indoors and that she'll do fine like that. My flat is quite small but she can see outside through the window, even tho the view isn't very exciting. 

She was doing really well but a few weeks ago she started getting restless and scratching the window like she wanted to go out. I decided to start leash training her and take her for walks. I believe she's enjoying them but now she won't stop meowing and demanding to go outside all the time! She scratches the door, tries to escape, destroys my furniture and even attacked me a few times when I picked her up and moved from the front door.

Would it be better to stop walks altogether? I really am not sure if she can be happy inside after living for 4 years as an almost wild, outdoor cat.

Odd-Knowledge3264,1647369310,tewblo,0,False,1,"We got my cat when he was 6 months old (the shelter found him wandering the streets).  We brought him home and took maybe 2 or 3 weeks putting him in a separate room so him and our older cat, at the time 6, could adjust to each other.  They never fully got along.  Fred (the kitten) would try to play with Annabelle (the older one) and she would NOT have it.  She would growl and hiss any time he came near.  Eventually, we‚Äôve speculated that he‚Äôs grown to resent her.  Now he purposely will sneak up on or or try to approach her and bat at her.  It‚Äôs never bad until Annabelle starts to growl and hiss, escalating the situation.  

It‚Äôs been two years and we still have to separate them a few times a day.  However they are also to a point where they can both sleep in the same bed through out the night.  (We got a puppy recently and that helped a lot with Fred‚Äôs energy, the two are best friends)

In hindsight, we probably shouldn‚Äôt have kept him.  But it‚Äôs been almost 3 years and tbh he‚Äôs probably my favorite out of them all cause of his personality. We manage to keep the cats away from each other when Fred is hyper and wants to go after Annabelle.  We also try to play with Fred when we can to get his energy out.  

The only thing is that he‚Äôs got an anger problem.  If he wants to do something and I don‚Äôt let him, he legit throws a temper tantrum and bites/scratches me or the dog. Afterwards he feels bad and tries to nuzzle into us, but it‚Äôs still weird.

divinelycaffeinated,1647318872,tegt2i,0,False,1,"Lola is 5 this month (hbd baby!) and she's a fighter. We went to the vet today. We went in on her leash bc she will pin herself in the carrier so we can't get her out. She was nervous but curious after the initial shock, but after she got her exam and rabies shot in the other room away from me, she was *not* happy. 

She swiped at the vet during her exam and wouldn't let the Dr check her mouth or her belly. When it was time to go, she was growling and hissing at both of us. I got her to look at me and said ""all done,"" which is our ""disengage"" signal. We've been working (slowly but successfully) on using this for everything: the end of play time, cuddles, feisty terror, the works. When I said this she immediately stopped her growling / hissing fit and I was able to set her on the ground. I pointed her towards her carrier (usually a safe place), but she growled and tried to walk past it. When I didn't let her she screamed and attacked my hand twice as I redirected her into the carrier. I was steady and unreactive, despite my bleeding hand. 

She's not usually *that* aggressive, but she is reactive when she's overstimulated and scratches often. ""All done"" is helping *a lot* because she understands that after we say that, she won't be touched / stimulated anymore so she can leave without us bothering her and calm down.

I have 2 questions:

1) I don't think she bit me, but there is some bruising. I know cat bites  an be bad, so what signs should I watch for to make sure it heals?

2) What in the world can I do to continue decreasing her aggression? And are there any tricks for this regarding the vet specifically?

yummilkyum,1647195033,tdcpmy,0,False,1,"I have two cats and they are very different. The older one is 1 year and  4 months. The younger one is almost 5 months. The difference with age, playing tactics, and energy makes intentional play difficult.

The younger one is super duper fast all of the time, has incredible kitten energy, and follows me everywhere and will play with everything/anything. The kitten doesn't seem to think and just act. The younger one doesn't jump too much and doesn't like dry treats. The kitten acts like it is the end of the world when I close doors to separate him from the older cat.


The older one is fast when he wants to be, but acts slow at first. The older one is more likely to jump and eat any kind of treat. He investigates everything, but acts disinterested when the younger one gets involved. He also seems to think before acting. He wiggles his butt for a hot minute before he jumps or runs.


They both snuggle each other, chase, and play with each other and seem to get along. I got the little one to be a good companion for the older one because I go on long runs on the weekends and focus on work on the weekdays. Everything seems to be going according to plan but the problem I am facing is differentiated play or intentional play.


If I try to play with both at the same time with wands, balls, automatic toys, Lazer, string, puzzles, etc, then the little one gets to the toy first and the older one will back up and just watch. I'll try to move the toy near the older one and put it up against the wall so he can have some bats and jumps at, and sometimes he'll give it a less than half-hearted attempt at it.  Then he'll go to the other side of the room to watch as the happy bouncy kitten runs in front of him to get to or stare at the toy.


I've tried isolating the kitten in the cat room while playing with the older one and I've had 50:50 success with it. Sometimes the older one will play and other times the cries from the kitten are too distracting, and the older will act disinterested in the toy and stare/stay by the door. The kitten is always screaming bloody murder when I do this too and scratching at the door.



I know the older one needs stimulation and likes to play. A day when I had a visitor and needed to clean one room. I had the visitor play with the older cat while I cleaned and played with the kitten. It worked!

I live in a very spacious apartment on the first floor with a big terrace area with a tall fence so I used to keep the litter box out on the terrace and he used it with no issues for 2 days until the vacuum cleaner incident...

We were cleaning and he was scared and went outside to the terrace... He was looking for any way out and he discovered that he can wiggle himself under the fence and he would go outside behind the fence and of course not come back when I call him back. Even with treats... He would be too distracted with all the smells, sounds and the birds on the trees. 

He likes going outside but I can't let him because he'll run away.... I really feel bad for that. 

So I moved the litter box to one of the toilets... He has his own room and toilet is inside the room and he poops in the box when I'm there... However when I'm not there he poops next to the box or in the kitchen corner close to door to the terrace. He is fine no issues with him medically however... He is not neutered yet.... Unfortunately his pervious owner didn't do it.... I'm waiting for him to settle well with me and wife... I don't want to stress him now in the new place... After that I'll chop them off.. 

He knows where to poop and he always pees in the box not even a single drop on the floor or anywhere else.

Yes both of them with two different kinds of litter types ... ... He started to be better for a day with two litter boxes  but.. Again when I'm not around he poops in the bath tub next the boxes or between them.

I tried to take him to litter box on regular bases all day and he would use it when I'm there and of course when he actually has to go but always in the morning I find some poop next to box...I'm not gonna lie I used to get frustrated in the beginning but not anymore I know I have to patient with him. 

I'm trying to rectify his behavior... I'm restricting his space by keeping him in the room only but I go there to feed him, play with him and just chill sometimes... Not gonna lie I feel very guilty but I'm hoping this might fix the issue but I'm really running out of ideas

When we are inside and home, they are not an issue. They respect the kitchen boundary and so not attempt counter surfing.

I typically put them in their cat room anytime we leave the house for more than 20min, but sometimes they will be left out if they have a comfy spot and are napping, or they are outside with us.

Recently, they have learned that when we leave the house, it opens up a small window period to browse the counter.  Typically I dont keep anything up there for them to get in to, but its is a kitchen, and sometimes food is defrosting or scraps are waiting to be cleaned.

Of the times I have caught them on the counter, I swat their butt for it.

I've tried the foil on the counter to spook them, overhanging pans are too obvious a trap, the mist sprayers they shrug off.

They have run of the house besides the dining room (cant jump on table) and kitchen area (aren't allowed at all), and they also have access to outside when it's nice out and I can monitor them. Both have plenty of things to do and ways to stay active and engaged.

My girl and I have an orange cat that we've had since birth, Sock. When Sock got older (around 10 months) we realized he was spraying. He would mark literally everything, the walls, toilet, kitchen, shoes, laptop bags, everything. We caught on when we found a bunch of shit smelling (gross, I know). So we looked into why he was doing this. First, we got him fixed. We thought this would end the spraying... It didn't. So we did more research. We thought maybe he was sick... Nope. We tried the store bought ""no spray"" liquids. Didn't work. We tried making our own with natural ingredients to not get him sick. Didn't work. We tried the indoor outdoor thing. This made it worse. We moved to kenneling him at night to see if that would calm him. Nope. We tried feeding him everywhere we found spray. He still sprayed. We tried putting treats where he sprayed. He still sprayed. Finally, we have put cat pampers on him so he can wonder around and not actually spray... He still sprays and now pees and poops himself normally cuz the pampers hold it in. I now have to put a new pamper on him everyday. He has a regular routine to use the bathroom but now he knows the pampers hold his pee and poop in so he doesn't even care to use the litter box during his scheduled times. And yes, the litterbox is cleaned of solids daily and we have bought 1000 different types of litter jic he doesn't like it.. we are also on our 4th litterbox jic he doesn't like the shitter itself.

He‚Äôs definitely not afraid of the room or being isolated in it ‚Äì he often goes into the room on his own to play with toys and never complains about being put into the room at bedtime.
 
However, around 5am each morning he‚Äôll start screaming in his room and tearing the place apart. Sometimes he‚Äôll scream for hours on end with a brief 30 seconds of silence. We‚Äôve made a point over the last couple weeks to not let him out until he‚Äôs calmed down (quiet for a minute or two and not tearing anything apart).

CharlieFaulkner,1646693218,t91svu,0,False,1,"Hi! So my kitten Maui is - we estimate - around 7 months old. We've had her for a month, since February 1st this year - found her crying and trapped in the garden of my student house on January 1, she spent a month in a rescue centre so I had time to move back home where cats are allowed and they could chip, vax, take care of health issues, etc - but we don't know anything about her past beyond this

So, um... it's been almost a month of her being here, and she is still hiding everywhere : ( She likes to come into my room but immediately hides under the bed, and hides behind the TV in the living room

We know from the rescue people if you stroke her she will hiss, but after she does so all her guard seems to go down - you can then pick her up and she'll literallly sit with you for hours without trying to wriggle away... the thing is, when you put her down again she seems to just ""forget"" you're a friend and she's scared again, and where she hides it's impossible to reach her to stroke her and get past that first hiss : (

We really need to socialise her and teach her that human touch and presence isn't scary (we reckon she was abused in her past home, the anxiety suggests so and when we found her her claws were clipped so short they'd hurt) - it can't be fun for the poor thing to feel like she has to hide everywhere, but I'm really in two minds of how to do this? On one hand I've heard so many stories of cats being with people for six months or more before they adjust, that they feel comfier if you sort of ignore and coexist with them and they'll always eventually start to warm up. On the other, my surrogate mum who I live with has been telling me I must be more proactive - try and stroke her, lie next to her for hours a day with my hand stretched near her till she comes to me - and I must do it before she isn't a kitten any more, because after that she'll be impossible to socialise (this is also backed up by her friend who socialised a traumatised cat of her own)

I... don't know what to do? On one hand I am nervous af if i do the coexisting and waiting months, years for her to come out she might literally never, but on the other I'm scared if I try and stroke her or am that close it might feel like she's being forced and send her backwards &gt;.&lt; Any advice of any kind would be really appreciated!",CatTraining,Socialising an incredibly anxious kitten?
Weebayy,1646687902,t8zrhf,0,False,1,"I've recently rescued a 3 year old cat and he's incredible affectionate but we're having a small challenge.

Food.

He is not food agressive... more impatient. 

He doesn't wait for his food bowl to hit the floor and tries to pull it down with his paws.

He also eats everything on his bowl, never leaves it for later.

We're feeding him to the recommendation of the animal sanctuary we resuced him from.

He will jump on any countertop, dining table to come sniff and eat any plate of food I have.

Treats are a big challenge, as with rich treats, he'll claws out grab at the hand with the treats just to get to them.

So far we've been consistently trying the following..

Regular meal times to try and provide some routine.

A consistent approach of lifting him off of tables and countertop as soon as he jumps up. 

So far no luck, this morning I lifted him off the dining table 8 times whilst I ate breakfast!

So my ""help me"" question is..

is this just a case of persistence, or is there anything else I can try to help train this out of him?

I adopted my now 1 year old orange tabby at 2 mo and he‚Äôs always been very sweet and VERY playful. Now that he‚Äôs an adult, however, his play aggression is really becoming an issue. 

Every website says you can help this with more interactive play (most say 20-30 min a day), but I‚Äôm literally playing with this cat every single day for at least 45 min - 1 hr and it‚Äôs still not enough. And I mean REALLY playing, like running around my entire apartment with a little mouse on a string literally trying to make it move like a mouse (I rotate the mouse attachment with a ‚Äúbird‚Äù attachment every few weeks to keep it interesting). In addition to this, he gets at least an hour more of what I call ‚Äúpassive playtime‚Äù where we‚Äôll play fetch while I‚Äôm watching TV. He also gets plenty of petting/snuggles when he‚Äôs in the mood.

I live alone and work from home at a very fast paced, high pressure job. I simply do not have enough time to play with this cat more than I am already, but 2 hrs/day doesn‚Äôt seem to be cutting it! After our usual play sessions when he wants to play more and I‚Äôm unable to, it often escalates to him jumping on and biting me repeatedly. He‚Äôs usually so sweet and cuddly, but when he‚Äôs in the mood to play, he gets this wild look in his eye and becomes relentless. 

Y‚Äôall, I have multiple cat scratchers/posts all around my 950 sqft apartment that I keep very clean so he can run around stress free to his heart‚Äôs content. I have 3 separate perches next to different windows for his cat TV time, and open the doors to my Juliet balcony every day that weather allows for him to have ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù, fresh air time. I have tons of other toys that I rotate for him to play with, I even bought a One Fast Cat wheel that he uses daily to try to help get his energy out and it‚Äôs still not enough! 

What do I do here? This might make me a bad cat mom, but I just don‚Äôt have enough time or energy to give him more undivided, interactive play time, especially since I‚Äôm already doing more than all of the resources I can find recommend. I try my hardest to have our playtimes around the same time each day, but often my work schedule doesn‚Äôt allow for this and I have to fit it in where I can.

AndreaWolfPhoto,1646680854,t8x1wi,0,False,1,"So I'll try to explain the situation with as much details as possible so that anyone who has any experience, or who has delt with a similar situation might help with any advice. 

We live in Bulgaria and animal behaviourists are not very popular. So, hoping there might be some in this group. 

Here's the situation. We have two cats. One grey, one white. Both 4-5 years of age. Both of them are not very social animals and have not been socialized with other animals. The white one we adopted as a kitten and raised her. She's very active, doesn't like to be pet often and is very curious. Rarely scared of anything. The grey one we adopted at 2 years of age after she had kittens and was on the streets for a long time. Probably had negative experiences with dogs. We've had her for 2 years now. She's very calm, loves to be pet for hours, and is also very scardy. Any loud noise or abrupt movement will make her run away.
Both cats co-exist, but don't really interact with each other much. They mostly ignore each other and rarely ""play"" with each other. By play, I mean 30 seconds of swatting at each other or one of them chasing the other to the other room. That's it. They sleep fairly close to each other sometimes, but never cuddle. 

3 months ago we got a puppy (1 month old at the time). We did the introductions gradually and the cats accepted him very quickly to our surprise. 
The pup is very calm, very smart, very sweet and doesn't really pay any attention to the cats. As long as his energy is spent, he doesn't chase them or want to play with them. 
The living situation is the following: 
One of the rooms is closed off by a baby gate that the cats can jump over when they want. The cats have their high spaces where they can escape and feel safe in every room. None of the animals are possessive of resources. They all share their water and food bowls.
We both work from home, so the animals are never alone. 

Now. The white cat and the dog get along great. They sniff each other, she lets the dog lick her and bite her gently, they sleep next to each other, she just runs away when she doesn't feel like interacting and even rubbs herself against him. 

The grey cat is the issue. 
She accepted the dog also very quickly, as in she is not stressed by him or doesn't even pay any attention to him, as long as he is not in her face. If he's around her, even when he's active and playful and barking, she's not affected by that - which is impressive as she is a very scardy cat and runs away at pretty much every loud noise.
They occasionally sniff each other when they walk past each other. That's it as far as interactions between these two go. 
The issue comes when the grey cat is lying on the bed or on the cat tree or on the chair and the dog gets closer in her face to sniff her. At this point instead of moving away or running away, she starts hissing at him, growling and strikes. 
The pup doesn't get that this means ""stay away"", he thinks she's playing with him, so we have to give him the command ""leave it"". He pretty much learned that he needs to leave this cat alone, but he occasionally goes to sniff her and get in her face and she hisses and strikes him.
We are really scared that she might hurt him. We try to keep the cats nails filed down, but still... 

The pup is 4 months old now and we want to have him sleeping outside of his puppy pen during the night, but we are scared of what might happen if these two meet without our supervision. 

A side note which might not be important: before we got the dog, the grey cat would spend a lot of time in the other room alone. Since we got the dog, she is constantly coming in the room with us where we work and spend most of our day and stays here. 

Sooo... the question is, what can we do to stop her from reacting in this aggressive way? 
We read a lot on the subject and have a couple of ideas, but haven't really tried any of them for a longer periode to be able to say ""this worked"" or ""this didn't work"". 
Would like to hear your opinions on these methods, as well as any other method that might help. 

One thing we read was to give the cat lots of treats when she is close to the dog and behaving good. She is very food driven, so that might help.
Another thing we read was to take her to the other room when she misbehaves, something like a time out. Also might help.
Last thing we read was to leave the situation to unravel on its own, because she basically learns that when she hisses and strikes the dog leaves her alone (because we give him the ""leave it"" command). So if we let him stay in her face, she'll learn that hissing and striking doesn't help and will just stop and change strategy to running away or getting higher up. The issue with this method is, that the dog thinks her reaction is playful and he gets riled up and starts jumping and barking, which stresses the cat even more and gets her even more on edge, so she might end up being more aggressive. (We tried this only once after making sure to cut her nails very short - the vet confirmed he couldn't get really hurt that way).

We decided on getting a second cat, who ended up being a 10 month old kitten with seemingly loads of bad habits he picked up from fosters and in his shelter. Lots of behavioral issues like stealing food, personal space issues, food possessiveness, super aggressive when slightly restrained/held firmly, etc. We‚Äôre slowly breaking these bad habits; he isnt up our butts when eating dinner or snacks, he lets us trim his claws without acting like we‚Äôre killing him, etc.

Our problem now is the interaction between our established cat and our new cat. As background, the first question someone will ask is, did you take time to do a slow introduction. Yes, we did everything of initial separation, scent and location swapping, slowly introducing visuals, eating in front of each other while physically separated, supervised play. Once our established cat seemed calm and unbothered, we let them loose to share the space together. This intro process took maybe a little over a month.

They have moment where they tolerate each other; they eat together, lay next to each other calmly, sleep next to each other while physically touching. But when they play, its quite aggressive and I think that sometimes it turns into fighting. I dont know how to prevent it. The younger one is playing with claws out (i think just because the older one is bigger and the younger one has a bad connotation with ‚Äúrestraint‚Äù) and the older one seems unbothered but the younger one is scratching him and we cant have that. I gave it a week or two to see if they would figure it out themselves and chill out but they havent. Now its been a month of them living together, and now when it gets too rough I break it up but I cant exactly do that while I‚Äôm sleeping. When they sit next to each other calmly or sniff each other calmly i reward with treats. Sometimes the older one gets tense when the younger one comes around which makes me upset because I want him to feel safe and I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs becoming anxious just coexisting with another cat.

Our 1 year old was not yet spayed so once she had her surgery and gave her time to rest, we began introducing them again, with higher hopes of this helping. The kitten accidentally got into her recovery room and they immediate snuggled. We let them do this supervised for a few days and once our 1 year old was better recovered, we let them roam the house together. They slept together, played together, licked one another, and  acted like best friends. All was well for around a week.

They immediately snuggled and seemed fine. A few days later, the same kind of incident happens where the older cat out of no where attacks.

throwaway013041,1646358330,t67hpz,0,False,1,"Hello, one year ago we got a male british shorthair kitten, it is our first pet ever and it was my mothers idea to get him, since she has some mental conditions my father also agreed that the cat might also help my mom a bit.

We got him when he was a baby and now he is around 1 year old, I don't know much about neutering and the behaviour which is associated with neutered and unneutered cats.

These past months however our cat has caused some headaches for us, for example he is extremely picky with his food, he just eats dry food and treats, he refuses to eat wet food.

I assume its because of his hormones perhaps.

Also he has become more aggressive and randomly jumps at someones hand wanting to attack, bites us very aggressively when we pick him up or sometimes he bites my hand and holds it very tight, while trying to hump my arm (I think thats what he is trying to do).

This behaviour is always getting more common and at night he runs around like crazy jumping on things and doing his ""mmrrrp"" sound, making all of us wake up and my mom is paranoid anyway so she often jumps to conclusions thinking that he must have hurt himself or something.

Yesterday it was the worst, nobody could sleep, he ran around like crazy and jumped on things so loudly that we thought something broke.

He doesn't spray, I don't exactly know what spraying is but it sounds like its simply peeing on things like walls or other places, he hasn't done that.

He is a housecat and never goes outside, we live in an apartment and I fear that one day he might run out because he often sleeps right next to the door, he started doing that around 3 months ago.

I need really good arguments for neutering.

I talked about neutering around 3\~4 times to my mother but she and my sister both have strong opinions against it, my mom has the ""they will hurt him"" arguments and my sister says that she once saw a tiktok where a cat died due to the Anesthesia.

My father doesn't really care but is more on the side of neutering him.

So in the end either I have to somehow walk to a vet because I have no car, or I have to convince them to get him neutered.

I really don't want him to learn how to spray and the behaviour of my mother and sister is starting to really annoy me since they are basically starting until our home turns into a circus.",CatTraining,"Our 1 year old cat is unneutered and has been very crazy these past days, should we neuter him?"

He was part of a litter and lived with my ex-roomates cat for the first year of his life. After my SO and I moved in together he got even more loving toward us but always seemed a little lonely. Him and my ex-roomates cat were extremely close. 

My SO and I decided to get a second cat so he could have a buddy. We ended up brining home a 2yo F (Cassie) on the 14th. She has never lived with another cat and initially he was extremely interested in trying to befriend her. Within the first few days they couldn't be in the same room without her hissing and growling at him. Now they can be within a couple feet of each other and they eat next to each other with no problem. But Theo has become disinterested in actively trying to befriend her the way he was initially. 

They chase each other around and Cassie won't hesitate to hiss at him to stop a pursuit. My SO and I can't figure out if this is play behavior or territorial. Pursuits get started by both of them but usually end with Cassie hissing Theo away. Theo also won't let Cassie lay next to him (he pushed her off the couch today). There is also a large size disparity between them (she's 9lbs and he's 16)  

Since bringing her home he has also stopped being as affectionate with us. He used to come up and lay on us every night and now he does it rarely. I think this might be because Cassie really likes laying in the bed?

Are they on their way to being friendly and are still adjusting? Or are these signs that they aren't getting along?

Quick history on his cat, since he does have a history...My boyfriend found him as a feral kitten when he was maybe 1-2 months old and gave him a home, got him vaccinated, etc.  The bad thing here is that in that time, 1) he didn't neuter him until recently due to money issues and 2) we found out later that while he was at work (This was before we were living together) his parents would lock his cat up in a closet for the whole day with his food, water, and litter box.  They were also doing this 24/7 while we were working with our landlord to have him here with us legally.  

When we had him with us, things went okay for the first week, more or less.  We slowly introduced him to my cat, and things seemed okay.  He was desperate to play with her and she didn't want to, so he would want to play with us.  One night, he kept poking me to play with him so I gave him a few minutes, but when I had to get up to get ready for bed, he bit me and I had to pry him off me.  It wasn't super hard, but wasn't soft or play-bite, either.  A few minutes later, we were in the bedroom getting ready for bed, and he came up to me again and tried the same thing.  I gently nudged him off me so I could get my pajamas on, and he threw himself back at me with a huge fit of violence (biting and clawing me until I was bleeding quite a lot) and screaming.  Boyfriend ran in, pulled him off me and set him down, and he immediately turned on my boyfriend and jumped at him screaming and trying to attack him the same way.  That night, every time we tried to leave the room, he would come up to us and seem normal, then slowly turn ""evil"" again and start screaming and attacking us again.

We got him fixed as soon as we could financially spare it, which was about 1.5 months ago.  He's improved in that there's no more attacks (yet, he still gets in weird, tense moods sometimes like he did before) and he no longer molests his bed and pillows.....but he won't stop attacking my cat and still gets into weird ""fits"" of energy where he comes to us for attention but then immediately starts biting us.

I don't think it's violent, since he will try to pounce her and then flop onto the ground and roll around and bat at her with his paw, but he escalates it to where he corners her, tackles her to the ground from the stairs and bites her hard, or chases her and corners her under the couch.  She never fights back, just runs away, and when she does this, he gets more aggressive.

We've been doing everything we can for both of them.  Made sure they have individual litter boxes, plenty of options for space to be both high and low, lots of toys, and we play with them together as well as isolated.  One thing we've noticed is that his cat gets weirdly territorial - not in the traditional way, but for example, like...we have an old chair sitting near the window with a blanket on it.  They both ignored it before when it was somewhere else, but moving it to the window made it a desirable seat.  My cat started taking naps there a lot, and when his cat finally noticed her there, he would go up to her while she was asleep and start slapping her over and over until she woke up and try to drive her out of the chair so he could take it.  We brought up another chair and put another cozy blanket on it and set it up right next to that one, and it worked for a bit, but he's back to ""If she's in a spot, then I want that spot"".  It's the same on the cat tower and with the cat tubes.  She doesn't instigate any of this, and tries to stay out of his way but he will go looking for her to terrorize her. 

 He was given a clean bill of health at the vet and nothing is abnormal.  When he's not wired up, he's a good cat.  Often he just comes up on my desk while I work and sleeps next to me, or sleeps at my feet.

universalwadjet,1645505851,syevg8,1,False,1,"I adopted a gorgeous tortie around June 2021 and she is now 2 years old. She's a pretty typical tortie in that she is quite independent, demanding, and full of tortitude. 

We don't really know her background other than that she was found as a tiny stray and taken to our local cat shelter. She was apparently not that easy to 'handle' at the shelter so she was taken into a foster caring program where she had the space to become more comfortable with humans. She did really well with her foster mum and was adopted by us around 2 months later. She never really showed any signs of aggression or discomfort with us and was sleeping on our bed by day 4. She's great at asserting her boundaries but loves to cuddle up as well. She basically loves nothing more than lying across my legs as I watch TV with my partner. She loves to play, loves to chase, loves treats, loves to watch the world, loves making biscuits. She is absolutely pampered (mainly by me).

Ever since we got her, I've made a conscious effort to play with her every single day so that she gets regular exercise and any excess energy out of her system. I'm the main one to pat her, I'm the main person she lies on, I'm also the main person to give her treats. Despite this, I am the only person she will 'attack'. She has never done it to my male partner.

It only really started in the past couple of months. Before that, we would play little games where I would walk past her and she'd tap me on the foot with her paw, or we'd play hide and seek. Now, she stalks me around the house and runs up to my leg, grabs it with her claws and bites into it. Pretty much every time she does this she draws blood. There have also been a few occasions where she has stalked me and tried to attack my face or hand if I'm lying down - all unprovoked. It's honestly quite scary and upsetting but I understand that she may not have been socialised properly as a kitten or possibly abused by someone in the past. I don't necessarily take it personally but I don't understand why she does it to me if I'm the person she goes to for everything. She also won't do it if my partner is in the room. 

I'm not sure if she's escalating her play behaviour or if she doesn't like me. The latter is harder for me to believe because she constantly comes to me for comfort and seeks me out for cuddles, though I do wonder if she basically loves me but doesn't 'respect' me in the same way she respects my partner. I am basically her bitch. 

She has a Feliway diffuser and Feliway spray, lots of comfortable quiet spots, an excellent diet, basically whatever she wants. I've reviewed some advice online and have tried going ""OWW!"" when she does it but I haven't been doing it long enough to see any changes in her behaviour. 

I've always grown up with cats so I'm extremely familiar with them, but she is my first tortie. Before her, I had snuggle bug ginger cats who were basically perpetual babies (lol!). 

I love her to death, just want to see how I can prevent this behaviour from re-occurring. She has no health conditions other than mild heart disease. Thanks!",CatTraining,My naughty tortie stalks me and bites my lower leg?
New_Promotion_3223,1645498721,sychd2,0,False,1,"Hello all, apologies for the long post but I really need some help right now. 

My boyfriend and I adopted my cat, Bobo (5yrs) about 2 months ago from the humane society and was notified that he‚Äôd had a history of some overstimulation aggression and we brought him home fully aware that some aggression may arise, but not quite to the extent that has been occurring. 

It started off as some biting for attention when I would get home from work, and then evolved into full on biting and scratching anytime I would sit on the couch. It has now progressed to full on attacks, jumping up and biting and scratching my legs and arms. He also weighs 22lbs but carries his weight very well. so these scratches usually bruise and are quite painful, and not easy to just shrug off. I have chalked it up to him being stressed and wanting more play/outside time, so me and my boyfriend have been incorporating more play into our busy schedules with work and school. This seems to have escalated his aggression towards me specifically. I take him on walks usually as soon as I get home from work or class, and then follow it up with playing until he his tired or seemingly uninterested. The problem is, he has started to stare me down almost like stalking behavior but with no widened pupils. He will then stalk after me and usually scratch me pretty bad. 

The latest incident happened after my boyfriend left for class and my cat started meowing for his dinner. After I fed him he kept meowing and getting up in my face so I tried playing with him but he was not engaged, still staring at me. When he didn‚Äôt respond to anything I decided to go sit at my desk when he pounced at me. I deflected him with my hand but accidentally pushed him into the side of my PC and he hit his head pretty hard. I felt bad immediately and tried to console him but he got, understandably, more upset and started aggressively coming after me. I went into my bedroom and closed the door and he started viciously tearing up the carpet and meowing. After about 5 minutes of this I opened the door only for him to charge at me again. He calmed down on the couch eventually but any time I would enter the room it was eyes on me immediately. 

My boyfriend and I are at our wits ends trying to figure out what is going on, as it‚Äôs starting to get really hard to focus on school with all of this going on, and are also terribly broke so spending a lot of money is not really an option. My boyfriend thinks it would be better all around if we put him up for adoption again but I really want to try working things out.

troydernd,1645493602,syao36,2,False,1,"Hey! I have two 2 year old female cats-sisters from the same litter. For the past two years of me having them, they've had no issues with each other &amp; would always play together &amp; occasionally sleep with each other. 

Recently, though, I've noticed my one cat (let's call her Orange) has become a bit aggressive toward her sister (let's call her White). It's nothing too serious-mainly I've noticed when White walks past Orange, sometimes she'll hit her &amp; cause her to run off. I've also seen Orange intentionally spot White &amp; run after her &amp; hit her. Everytime White looks at Orange or goes near Orange, she kinda makes a scared posture &amp; backs away slowly, like she's scared of her.

I've been trying to think of what could've possibly caused this shift in behavior &amp; I've come to a few points that could be contributing.

1.) White has always been the more affectionate cat with me-always jumping on my lap &amp; asking for pets. We have a few daily routines where she's the most affectionate &amp; constantly asks for pets. 

Orange has always been super friendly &amp; affectionate as well, but not to the level of White, &amp; also tends to prefer to sit alone in the other room sometimes, whereas White is always near me. Since this has been consistent behavior from the beginning, I've always made sure to take extra time to give Orange attention as I never wanted her to think I didn't care about her &amp; that her sister was getting all the attention. I just think this is an important point to make to give some background on their previous behavior.
 
2.) I recently (4 weeks ago) started a new job where I'm working remotely at home everyday. I used to work 9-5 in an office, so I'm sure this change has affected them. I figured they'd be happy having someone home all the time &amp; having the ability to go on the patio all day &amp; look outside, but this is when I started noticing the behavior change.

Ever since being home more often, I've noticed White has latched onto me a lot more than before. She's become an intense lap cat (which of course I love). But with this, I've noticed Orange has drifted from being the occasional lap cat she used to be. Times when Orange would usually jump on me &amp; ask for pets, White now does it then instead. I've noticed Orange hangs out in the other room a lot more now by herself. I try to go in the other room &amp; give her as much attention as she'd like, while also giving her the space she needs as well. But these are all just things I've noticed.

3.) I only have 1 cat tree. When I first adopted the cats, Orange claimed the top level &amp; would sleep there every night. But it didn't take long for White to eventually claim it as her own &amp; ever since, the top level has been hers &amp; Orange has found other spots to sleep. I'm wondering if getting another cat tree could help the situation &amp; give Orange a new spot equal to White.

While I feel like it seems White has kind of bullied Orange &amp; taken over all her spots &amp; attention, shes never been anything but affectionate to Orange. She's always has been the most curious, with Orange following behind her in new settings or with new people. And even within the last few weeks, I've seen them play together, but I can't fully tell if it's play or aggression. There's never been any hissing or howling during this play, but during these times, they'd have fat tails &amp; kind of circle each other before attacking.

I guess I'm just wondering what things I can do to help the situation? I'm assuming with all of these previous points, that it's probably jealousy? 

I plan on getting another cat tree, but other than that, so far I've just been going out of my way to give Orange extra attention so she can hopefully begin to resent her sister a little less. I've also made sure to spend time with both cats together, particularly when they're out on the patio as that's a spot you can find them together all the time (even with this current tension).

Husselbeh,1645047384,su748g,2,False,1,"Hi, I'm just wondering if anyone knows what the cause of this outburst of aggression would be with our cat. We're early on in the training process, doing some simple things like leading with a finger, sit etc. 

We use dreamies to train him, and keep the sessions short, 5/10 mins max. Afterwards we'll praise him with a fuss and stroke his head, and scratch behind his ear. That's usually his favourite place to be petted. For some reason though he's been showing some level of aggression when trying to fuss him after the training session has ended.

Tonight, I was just giving him a few quick strokes and praising him and he just swiped at me and bit me, drawing blood from the swipe. This only usually happens in 2 situations, if we're playing and he gets carried away or if we try to rub his belly. 

He seems to enjoy the training and is really up for doing it so I don't feel like the training is the issue. Is this just typical food aggression because I no longer have treats in my hands? Again, that's strange because he's very gentle with treats that we give him, and even allows us to pet him while eating his main meals (though we tend not to do this often.)

chubbycat09,1645043668,su5oi0,7,False,1,"Fellow feline lovers. I come to you at my most desperate hour.

Just some background on the culprit. She is about 8 years old, she is FIV+ (most likely due to a deep scratch from a street brawl before she was adopted). She hates being picked up but she is extremely friendly. She eats about 90% dry food, 10% wet food. Vet has always said she is in great health despite her FIV (most recent checkup was 2 weeks ago)

The culprit has long struggled with litterbox etiquette. She is confined to our VERY spacious basement because my parents get super nervous about their furniture given her history with this problem. We give her lots of attention as the basement is my family's favorite hangout spot. I clean the litterbox everyday and every few days I add more litter. Every so often she would mysteriously poop outside the litterbox while keeping her pee inside the box. This was never a problem for me as when I arrive at the crime scene it was dry and easy to clean. However in the rare instance that she peed outside the litterbox we would have to completely replace that area of the carpet. We now keep the litterbox on top of a ton of newspaper just in case. The last couple days she pooped outside her spotless litterbox and this morning she peed outside it as well, completely seeping through the paper and into the carpet. We've spent multiple thousands of dollars on replacing this carpet. 

I feel it is important to mention that whenever she begins a pooping phase that lasts multiple days  it is ALWAYS in the same spot as the previous day. Sometimes moving the litterbox over the spot will help but a couple days later she'll sometimes finds a new spot.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Why is she doing this? Is this a cry for attention or an act of spite?

Recently we have been giving her free reign of the house (with supervision) but at the end of the day she always goes back in the basement. I thought it might be possible that she's acting out because she's sad about being confined in the basement after getting a taste of more freedom however she's done this in other houses that I've lived in as well where she had free reign of the entire house.

I have to keep them separate all day because the kitten goes straight to attack my older cat whenever they're in the same room unless I actively distract him with treats (toys no longer work).

This time was pretty similar, she was with us all time and she seemed not afraid of them, she was even sitting by their side on the couch, but after the guest left we found out that she had pooped in our bed (she sleeps with us in the bed). We though that she did that because the only litter box that we had is near to the room where we all were and since she didn't knew the guest she did not feel safe enough to go to the litter box.

We changed the quilt and the sheets since she pooped on them and she was scratching like she does in the litter box. 

Well, this morning she also peed on the bed with completely different clothes, so we added another litter box with gray only (the other one, the one she always had is gray and scent crystals mixed), she already used the new litter box this afternoon,but now she just peed on the couch.

We are quite confused and we don't really know what's happening with her, we suspect that she may be getting her period because since last week she does not eat very much (she used to eat a lot before), she does not listen to commands as much as before and she sometimes rubbs her vagina against couch or bed.

Hi,

so the problem is already stated in the title. For a few weeks now, my male cat (1.5 years old) became super picky about his food.

He'd usually leave some food on his plate after eating but now he takes a few bites maximum and leaves the plate full. We've tried a lot of high quality catfood, wet and dry (usually he gets a mix of both anyways), he doesn't really seem to like anything. 

He does eat enough and is still almost on the chubby side, but we have to throw away a LOT of catfood because he will only eat food that's freshly out of the box. If it's been sitting there for more than 5 minutes, he usually won't eat it.

The problem is, he keeps meowing at us begging for food, he even gets pretty aggressive from time to time. I definitely notice he seems to desperatly WANT something but I can't figure out what.

Other than that, he's been drinking, sleeping and playing normally, no trouble with going to the toilet either. But I also don't really know what to look for.

I rescued a little Tortie/Calico about a year ago. I have never been so in love with an animal. She is the sweetest, snuggliest little cat I‚Äôve ever owned. I love her to death.

I adopted her while working from home. When I brought her home she was emaciated and clearly had come from a rough upbringing - she had apparently been a shelter/street cat her entire upbringing and she was over a year old when I adopted her. 

The quick transition from shelter/street life to a warm loving home, and the fact that I have been home nearly 24/7 for the past year has led her to be very codependent. Which is sweet. Except this cat cannot go without attention for‚Ä¶ any amount of time. And she is WICKED smart. She has spent months experimenting around the house to see what gets a reaction out of me and my SO, and then repeats those behaviors again and again. Sometimes I even catch her looking around trying to think of something new and disruptive to do.

She finds any glass object she can knock over. We have a flag above the couch she will launch up and climb until it‚Äôs ripped off the wall. She hooks into the wallpaper and slides down the wall. She chews on my headphone wires. She actually jumped onto my wine shelf yesterday, grabbed the bottles with her arms and tried to kamikaze, bottles in paw. I had to jump up and abandon my call to avoid disaster.   

If I‚Äôm sleeping, she stands on the headboard and tears off the wallpaper, rips off wall decals, pulls down fairy lights, and will even attack me in my sleep (she‚Äôs an otherwise sweet cat). 

If I lock her out of a room to get some peace, she will grab the bottom of the door with her paws and shake the door violently while yelling. 

I literally lose sleep and miss out on tons of work because of this. I can‚Äôt lock her of the room at work because I run meetings and take calls, and the howling is almost worse then her antics in the background. You can understand how the bedroom is a similar scenario. My home is pretty snug and I can‚Äôt get more than 1 closed door away from her. 

The hilarious part of this is if I am NOT sleeping or working, she does NOTHING WRONG. If I‚Äôm away from the house and she‚Äôs alone, even for a couple days,she doesn‚Äôt mess with ANYTHING. She‚Äôs even fine hanging and watching TV, scrolling, ect. But if I‚Äôm around, and I‚Äôm engaging in something that requires my undivided attention, she destroys my home.

The only luck I‚Äôve had deterring her has been a dry shampoo bottle- she doesn‚Äôt like the sound. But she‚Äôs still relentless and will keep repeating the behavior for hours. I tried a water sprayer but I hate using it, it feels inhumane, and she‚Äôd let herself get soaked before she stopped. 

When I first got her and these issues began to show up, someone advised to remove her, don‚Äôt react, don‚Äôt give in. I did this for weeks and she just became more relentless. 

She is genuinely the sweetest cat when I‚Äôm chilling with her. She just can‚Äôt stand me doing anything that doesn‚Äôt involve her.

Sad_Ocelot333,1643935659,sjzkuo,0,False,1,"Hi, everyone! Having been woken up just now, I have resorted to asking a question online.

At night, my female cat (2 years old) keeps biting my wool blanket that I sleep with. It's covered with a blanket cover/sheet (sorry, don't know the word for it in English). She sleeps on the bed right until I go to sleep, 5 minutes pass, she wakes up and starts biting hard on my blanket. She has bit right into my toes or legs several times and drawn blood. This happens every other night. Right after I push her out of the bed and tell her to stop, she goes to eat her dry kibbles, then comes back to sleep.

She does not bite the blanket of my husband ever.

At first I thought it was her way of asking for wet food since she likes to eat more than the rest of our 2 cats, but I have never gotten up to give her wet food during the night after her expressing this behaviour because I knew it would mean that she will remember that and always ask for it during the night. The cat is well fed and even remembers her feeding times during the day.

She never does this during the day and is always sweet, does not attack us. I'm guessing I will just have to switch to another blanket (even thought I really like this one), but perhaps someone has had experience with this? The vet never saw any problem with her gums or teeth, she is in good health.",CatTraining,Cat bites through wool blanket at night
ch33s3puffs,1643928723,sjwxuv,0,False,1,"I've got two 11 month old kittens, Carlos and Lando. They're from the same litter and have always been together, never spent a day apart. Even when they were neutered they were put in the same recovery area.

Lando needed to go to the vets this afternoon to have a check up of his gums. No medicine etc was supplied. He was away for 2 hours maximum and as soon as we came back, Carlos was hissing and growling at Lando. He'll occasionally swipe for him too.

As far as I can tell there's not really been any involvement of claws, no big back, no big tail from Carlos. We've tried to make Lando smell of us and home by rubbing him with blankets, our pillows (because they sleep there) etc. It's been 5 hours and nothing has really changed...

I can't bare the thought of my boys not getting along when they had been best friends and inseparable up to this point. I'm at my wit's end of trying to get Carlos to like Lando again. Lando is a very independent kitty but this evening he's been following Carlos around like his shadow trying to get his attention. It's heartbreaking to watch üòî

I am a medical student with a lot of virtual classes so i am frequently home at my desk studying. I play with him at LEAST 20 minutes a day (usually separated with 1 in the afternoon and 1 in the evening), give him a treat puzzle everyday, have some automatic interactive toys, and make sure to let him window sniff or at least watch through the window everyday. From 3 months old to 1 year old we lived in an apartment with a roommate and her puppy who he'd play with often, but now we live in a single because of personal differences and the dog being very poorly potty trained and constantly barking all day long. 

He recently started attacking me almost every single day. I think he is doing it for attention because he will do it as I'm walking towards my desk, or if I'm cleaning the apartment walking around and not paying him much attention. I will push him off of me and try to create distance but he will just keep pouncing on my leg if I'm standing, my arm if I'm sitting, or even my head if I'm laying.

I suffered hand injuries on both hands that stopped me from being as active playing with her and her spirit seemed to just get crushed more each day. So I eventually caved and let her outside. She does come home whenever I call her which is good. 

Well, it ends up she's way more of a hunter than any other cat I've had and she's on a massive killing spree. At first she killed the rats messing with my garden which was good. It's unreal how fast she took care of them.

But, the problem began now about 5 months into her being both indoors and outdoors and she's been killing the neighbor's birds that he feeds. Killing rats is fine by me because of all the damage they do but the little songbirds don't hurt anyone and they're being taken care of by a loving human nearby. It's pretty heartbreaking.

But at the same time whenever I've kept her inside before it seemed to make my cat really depressed and angry at me. I feel like she's keep it up forever.

As a note I may be moving to Alaska sometime this year and I really doubt it'll be good for her to go outside there. She'll have to be indoors.

detectiveDollar,1643905297,sjna0f,0,False,1,"Hey all, my girlfriend and her two cats (lived together for a very long time, introduced as adults) moved in with my brother/his girlfriend and I (we have two cats that have lived together from a super young age) about 5 months back and we've been having issues with one cat in particular constantly attacking the new comers.

There's 4 in total

Noel: 5 year old Female. Orange cat, the vicious attacker. Sweet to humans except seems to get overstimulated easily. I don't want to talk trash, but her owners are fairly lazy and don't seem to play/exercise with her much.

BB: 2.5 year old brown/dark green/gray tiger stripes Female. Sometimes hisses and meows at the new cats but is mostly alright with them. Even will touch noses and play with Precious sometimes.

Her cats:

Precious: around 8 year old grey/white male. Has chronic anxiety and has been to the vet for it (he over groomed his back even before she moved in) but does cuddle when relaxed. He's the primary target of Noel.

Osiris: around 8 year old male. Extremely relaxed and cuddly cat with a loud purr. Never aggressive aside from occasional love nibbling toward people. I'm not sure what breed he is (definitely not a mancun) but he's much larger than the other cats.

Initially Noel was mostly fine with the two newcomers aside from occasional hissing while BB was the main aggressor but for some reason that switched. From the start we had Osiris and Precious stay with us in our room with their own food/water/litter/toys while the other two had the rest of the house and their own things.

Once BB calmed down we let her come in/out of the room (she'd scratch the door when she wanted to come in/leave) and supervised them, and they were perfectly fine. We bought a cat door with a lock that screwed into our bedroom door to make this easier. Meanwhile Noel was still hyper aggressive and would attack Precious on sight (occasionally a cat manages to slip through a door accidently left open. This hasn't happened too often. We break up these fights and use a blanket to move Noel out of the room so she doesn't instinctively redirect her aggression to us).

Eventually we gradually gave Osiris, Precious, and BB free reign of the house and shared resources while having Noel in her parent's room with her own food water and toys. At least every other evening, we do try to let Noel out of her room when people are home but keep Osiris and Precious in our room with the cat door shut. The problem is that BB and Precious constantly want to go in/out of the room and will scratch the door so we can't have Noel out overnight. Plus if Noel somehow manages to open the cat door it'd be disastrous (I don't think she can, it locks by turning a miniature doorknob).

We're kind of at a loss for what to do, it feels like we've tried everything. We may tried to restart the process again but it feels like we can't even get to the stage where we can have them see eachother.

I currently live in a 1 bedroom apartment with my male tuxedo cat who is turning 2 this April. On Friday, I adopted an 11 week old male tabby. I‚Äôve kept the kitten in my bedroom while my resident cat has free roam of the rest of my tiny apartment. He did, unfortunately, catch sight of the cat upon entry but didn‚Äôt really pay much mind. Initially it seemed he hated the scent of the new cat, but has since made progress sleeping on blankets that have been swapped between rooms and playing with toys that have been swapped as well. My resident cat is also confident enough to sniff my bedroom when I move the kitten to the bathroom for a couple minutes. 
He definitely knows the kitten is behind the door because he shows interest in approaching the door. When I see him sniffing the bedroom door while the kitten is inside, he isn‚Äôt growling but looks more curious/nervous. However when I approach him, he begins to growl. It seems the only time he growls at the kitten is when I am in close range to them both. 

Today I managed to have them each look at eachother through a baby gate and they ate treats on opposite sides within 6 feet of eachother. They watched eachother play with toys, but my resident cat did hiss twice and growled for a few minutes. He was more distracted by the kitten and couldn‚Äôt focus on playing. Still improvements from day one. 

The issue begins because by Friday I have to move to my parents 2 story house for 2-4 weeks before I get the keys to a new apartment. So two changes of environment over the course of 5 weeks, all while introducing two cats. My kitten will stay upstairs in my brothers bedroom, and my resident cat and I will be sleeping in the basement. Believe me, this was not the plan, but life has hit and we are needing to adapt. 

My question is: will the larger home benefit the introduction or hinder the progress I‚Äôve made? Or will introducing them in the new apartment be smoother because it is technically nobody‚Äôs territory yet??

Any advice is greatly appreciated, I‚Äôve been such an anxious mess over making sure both cats adjust.

Can you ever stop clicker training, without losing the trained behavior?

I cannot really find an answer to that. If a cat has learned a certain behavior, do you need to keep rewarding that behavior forever?

Hissed through a screen, we then, also in error, tried to introduce them, they got along for a minute or so until resident cat pins kitten and starts getting rough.

Here's where we are now.

We have been feeding them behind a screen (with visual contact) because our resident cat actually tolerates that very well. No hissing, charging, puffing up, anything.

xhayleyquinnx,1643627141,sgyrje,0,False,1,"So we have a TV in the bedroom, we also have a medium sized cat tree, a dresser with a blanket and cushion for him to sit on with a view out of the window, a radiator cat seat he won't use, another blanket and pillow on top of another narrower dresser, and another blanket, pillow and cat bed on top of a taller shelf. With the exception of the cat tree which is on the left of our bed, all these perches are linked so he can walk between them, which he does and has been enjoying.

However between the first dresser and the door is our TV stand and TV, so I can understand he wants the straight line of travel off the ground, and wants to walk behind the TV to get to the door. He can however also cross the bed as well.

I would just let him go behind the TV if he was using it to pass by, however he isn't, he's going back there and then having a stretch by standing upright, resting his front paws on top of the tv, knocking it over. We've had to catch it a few times before we started blocking off the back of the TV so he couldn't get down there. Every single day we have to remove him because although he's not made it behind the TV very often, he's jumped up onto the cramped TV stand on the 3cm of space we've not covered in something and he's now not got enough room to move anywhere or turn round and get back down.

If we push the TV back he just instead jumps up in front of it and stays there as we're watching it until we move him (he also does this one in the living room where he doesn't care about going behind the TV but likes to punch and paw at the screen only when we are in the room even if it's off). Or he stands up and paws at the TV or leans on the top of it nearly knocking it backwards instead.

What can I do here? He isn't bothered by foil or tape, doesn't care about spray bottles or scent deterrents, doesn't stop if we hiss, if we remove him he just gets mad and starts rushing us to bite us. There's nothing back there for him at all, no toys, no food, just dust. He's not even interested in the cables. He just wants to go there and push the TV over. He's got lots of scratching posts, multiple trees in the house of different sizes, more toys than we have room for and we play every day, he gets enough food and has two litter boxes in different locations, his food and water are in different places and not near his litter, he's in good health for the most part and he's got good enrichment and window views in almost every room bar the bathroom (top floor flat, window is a skylight in the roof).

Why is he like this. I have accepted if he has not stopped in 5 years he's going to keep trying, doesn't matter if he crushes himself with a TV in the process. What can I do so he can pass behind the TV but can't knock it over or scratch it? I was thinking about one of those collapsible tunnels he could run through, if it's round he can't stand on top and continue to knock the TV but I'm just worried that might be a fire hazard next to plug sockets. I'm in rented accommodation so can't build any cat shelves around the TV or I'd have done that ASAP bc at this point I'll build him anything he wants, any tribute to the devil, and human sacrifice if it means he'll stop trying to end himself.

Worth noting he also seemingly does this twice as much the second I am on the phone at work. If I work in the office and my partner is not at his computer, he will do the same exact thing but with my partners monitors. At this stage I can't tell if he's trained me to react and give him attention when he's getting himself wedged between walls and screens or what because I've tried ignoring him and he just carries on happy as a clam who's destroying our property.

The female loved the other female who died. She's also ok with the senior male, although they rather co-exist. The problem is now with the male kitten. She hunts him down and attacks him.

She's not a very loud cat in general, she only rarely hisses and her meows are very quiet. But she makes zero sound. No hissing, no growling, just attacking.

I love them both so much, I need advise. They have their own rooms now, but for half of the day, one of them gets to roam freely (except the other cat's room) and the female sleeps in my bed at night.

shmaviellethegreat,1643553044,sgacsn,0,False,1,"Background. This is my first kitten, always had dogs before this so forgive me if this is silly or normal.   Found a kitten in the woods in November. Vet guessed he was 6-8 weeks old at the time. He's been amazing, very chill, responded well to training, very playful, and very respectful when he played (would paw at me but never draw claws, no biting, gentle play). 

Took the kitten for his neuter 5 days ago. The first two days after he was very sleepy as to be expected. Day 3 and onward he was been very aggressive towards me (f) and my partner (m). He comes up for pets and cuddles and will suddenly claw and bite me hard. I am having a hard time figuring out when it goes from cuddles to ""play"". Not to the point of blood yet but it hurts. He has also been teasing the dog suddenly (who is recovering from a paw injury, 100lbs, and loosing her patience), this wasnt an issue prior.

INNAHHNET,1643539894,sg6q9t,0,False,1,"Hello! So I‚Äôm posting this in hopes of getting some advice on my cat. This is gonna be a long one. A little backstory, I have cat named Terra. She‚Äôs older, around 5 or 6 the vets believe. I found her on the streets, declawed and starving and have had her for about 4 years(?). Anyways, last year in October I took in a new kitten (2 weeks old) as a foster (he‚Äôs a foster fail now lol). She hasn‚Äôt warmed up to him AT ALL within these past couple of months and usually keeps her distance and stays in my room. But she has started peeing on my bed :( It‚Äôs annoying and frustrating to come home everyday after work to a big pee spot on my bed and it‚Äôs stressing me out! I did take her to the vet and they determined she had a UTI and elevated kidney levels. She had a short stay at the vet which didn‚Äôt do much in bringing down her kidney levels so they put her on a new prescribed diet. Sadly, I had to take her to another vet in Mexico (I live in a border city) because I could not afford the vet here where I live. They basically told us the same thing about her kidney levels, so I‚Äôm assuming that means the diet hasn‚Äôt been working. The only thing they said we could do was give her proper diet and that should help. So my question is, why is she peeing on my bed?? Could it be because of her kidney levels or the new kitten? I keep them as separated as possible which isn‚Äôt hard because like I said, she prefers to hang out in my room and keep to herself. Also, I have her litter box in my room so there‚Äôs no problem in her finding it. She has easy access to it. Please give me some advice on what I can do to prevent her from peeing on my bed.

I tricker train my cat. It had a moderate skill level with behavioural training, but I'm having trouble with meow training.

Has anyone had success in this and what did they do?

I only use positive reinforcement when training my cat.

My problem is, is that I don't know how to elicit a meow in the first place to teach my cat that meowing = click/treat, and to then attach that to a sign.

Has anyone done this with any success? Online guides do NOT work for this, they say to meow until the cat meows, she looks at me like I'm fucking stupid, and she doesn't learn well when stressed.

She IS very vocal, but as soon as the clicker is out she is in ""concentrate"" mode and is extremely focused. Also she trills instead of meows when communicating too further frustrating it.

For example, if I meow at her she might say: ""Trilllll?? \[confused noise\]"". Idk it sounds more like a sound a pokemon might make then a meow

So yeah I'm stuck

AylaKittyCat,1643465909,sfj0nv,0,False,1,"Hi

We are getting quite desperate and I'm hoping someone can help. Cat training isn't really a thing in our country so we can't really turn to a professional without spending hundreds. 

One of our cats is obsessed with food and it has become a burden to us. We love him dearly, and he is super sweet, but he is OBSESSED with food. He's on a diet because he's too chonk, but even before that, he'd literally eat until he burst and demand more. 

We feed him three times a day at standard times, lately he's been coming to us up to 2 hours before feeding time and will literally stare us down.   


The moment we get up to get his food, the wailing and screaming begins. He will NOT STOP meowing, loud and demanding until we put food in front of him. How can we make him stop? It's not a normal meow, it's a SCREAM.

What we've tried:

\- Ignoring him until he stops (he will not, we've waited for 10+ minutes)

\- Punishing meows by tapping him on the nose every time he meows (he does not understand)

\- Waiting until he loses interest in his food (but the moment we move it starts again)

\- Locking him out of the kitchen until his food is ready (he'll continue screaming)

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas are highly appreciated. He's a sweetheart, but he's not the smartest, so I feel like he doesn't understand a lot of things. Thank you!",CatTraining,"Cat extreme demand meowing, how to stop it?"

She has been living with my fiance and I since October and has yet to learn the rules. She jumps on the table, jumps on the counters, rips up the carpet, rips up the couch, goes after the plants, plays with cords, steals off the coffee table, plays with anything she can, and worst of all, climbs inside the couch. Like I said, I'm a dog person, but it seems like she just doesn't understand boundaries/social roles. We have to tell her off constantly, but it usually doesn't work so we either have to physically remove her or spray her with the water bottle. I've recently learned that the spray bottle does not work, which is why I'm here. 

We give her 10 minute time outs in the bathroom for her to calm down, but it doesn't seem to work because she's back to being crazy almost instantly. She gets lots of playtime playing fetch or with a mouse toy or laser pointer. I do play a little rough with her but she knows not to be too rough. Could that be an issue?

She has a robotic toy that we turn on sometimes just for some peace of mind. She usually has to go into the bathroom for the night because she's constantly getting into stuff. She can play with her toys at any time.

The worst thing she does it get into the couch. This is our first couch that's not a futon so it's pretty nice to us. A remote fell through the wood and got stuck between the wood and the lining underneath, so we had to cut a hole to get it out. She has gotten in there a number of times and rips holes in the fabric. She will not come out unless we coax her with various treats and toys. We eventually turned the couch to the side and closed the hole with duct tape. Apparently she ripped it off because she was just inside.

She's very vocal and loving, though. It's like she has two moods. She's either sleepy and cuddly or playful and naughty. She can't be mad at us or anything because we've developed such a bond and she shows so much affection.

Where do we even start here? She's not interested in treats at all even though she has scheduled meals. I've heard that you can give them boiled chicken. I don't know about cuts of meat, but I'm assuming I need to buy chicken breast? I'm a little worried about the fat content, though.

My family and I have a 6 year old cat that we‚Äôve had since she was a kitten. She‚Äôs been a good cat, and a pretty ‚Äúnormal‚Äù cat. However, we mistakenly ‚Äútrained‚Äù her that biting and scratching playfully is okay. Now she does it to everyone, and bites hard to family and strangers alike when they just try to pet her.

We understand cat cues about when to stop petting and where not to pet - but sometimes she is still very quick with this aggressive biting. 

As far as playing, i try to immediately ignore her if she bites or scratches me when i try to play with a toy with her.

trans-confused,1643211710,sd8u8a,0,False,1,"1st time posting so if I've missed something, my bad - but I did try to read what I could! 

Some background info, before we get into it:
- My father worked at a tow company in 2021, and in May, he was sent to pickup a pickup truck destined for the crusher, but when he opened its back (it had a camper shell on it), 4 kittens were panicking. He managed to grab one, and took him home. This would be Yoda.
- I called a vet to ask if Yoda could eat normal cat food despite being about 5 weeks old (they said yes, though soft food would probably be necessary). So he starts eating wet cat food at 5 wks old.
- Yoda stays with my parents. I lived with my grandmother at the time. At about 7mo old (so late Nov early Dec 2021), Yoda has begun regularly fighting with my parents' cats, Luna and Sierri. He is urinating inappropriately - 'spraying' - and my parents want to get him fixed but vets are backed up and the low cost spay/neuter clinic wouldn't open until Jan 1st 2022.
- I moved back in with my parents in Dec 2021, but moved into the garage, which was renovated into essentially an apartment for me. 
- Dec 26th, 2021 I wake up to a text from my mother saying they threw Yoda outside after he peed in their bed while they were asleep, including on my mother's brand new weighted blanket she got for Christmas.
- Yoda disappears without a trace for about 3 weeks, reappearing Jan 16th or 17th. He's skinny and panicked, but comes to me, and I take him into the garage to keep him from being thrown out again.
- The garage is essentially just one big room, and I already have a cat, a (neutered) male named Two-Socks. Once again, vets are very backed up, and the earliest appointment I can get for Yoda to be neutered is Feb 1st (or that's at least when I can sign up for it - no guarantee it'll be done that day or any time soon, really).

The problems:
- Yoda suckles on ALL fabric. Blankets, fuzzy pants, pajamas, couch cushions, his cat bed - anything and everything will be suckled on. This normally wouldn't bother me except he produces a TON of saliva while doing it, leaving anything he does it too smelling gross and beyond wet.
- Yoda has no concept of personal space, nor that his claws hurt. He will just jump on you, claws out, and get as close to your face as possible. He is VERY persistent. I don't mind him laying in my lap (as long as he's not suckling the blanket....), but he doesn't want to lay in my lap. He wants to lay on my chest, in my face, using his claws the entire time. I don't understand this because Two-Socks doesn't do that, even when he gets on my chest. He just lays down and is gentle. (All that being said, I want to clarify that Yoda is never being aggressive. He's extremely affectionate, gives affectionate headbutts constantly, and like a storm. He's clearly trying to be affectionate but I think his understanding of what's appropriate for that is.... Bad).
- Yoda has started to bully Two-Socks, to the point of Two-Socks running away if Yoda even so much as looks like he's going to come near him. Two-Socks won't play with me with his toys if Yoda is too close, because he's too busy staring at Yoda. Two-Socks clings to me if Yoda is out and about.
- Because of all these problems, I had to get a big dog cage, put a litterbox in it, a cat bed, and leave Yoda in it overnight or whenever tempers between him and Two-Socks flare too bad, or to sometimes just give Two-Socks a break so we can play and he can relax.

The solutions I've considered:
- Cat behaviorist - I make pennies right now, as does the rest of my family. I'm disabled and struggling to find jobs I can do. I even had an interview scheduled for this morning but they straight up...never called me. I legit make $300-$400/wk, and that's not even considering bills or weekly expenses. There's just no way I could pay a professional to help.
- Rehoming - I'm scared of this option. Yoda clearly has problems and is a LOT of cat. I'm scared that doing this will just end in him getting dumped on the streets again. I thought he was dead when he vanished for 3 weeks because it was frigid and snowing that entire time here, and he'd never been outside on his own since he was a 5wk old kitten. I dunno if I'd be that lucky a second time.
- Getting him neutered and hoping it fixes a lot of his (at least) domineering behavior towards Two-Socks.
- Playing with him throughout the day to keep him exhausted, and caging him for a ""timeout"" whenever he gets too aggressive with Two-Socks. I've also considered getting more toys they can play with independently, that might help them focused on toys and not each other (I do have to work and I don't know if I can justify leaving Yoda in the cage all night + when I work, so i leave Yoda out when I'm at work for now. But obv this is a problem since I can't monitor him and Two-Socks to make sure they're not fighting).

Any help or advice is helpful. I'm just so lost. I know it's not Yoda's fault, life's dealt him a really shit hand, but I don't know if I can live like this for the foreseeable future. He's only 9 months old, we've got potentially another 15+ years of this...",CatTraining,I'm at my wits end.

When I notice them doing something I'd rather they don't do, I do my best to redirect them or remove the opportunity to do it again since I know that punishment doesn't really work with cats, or at least is not recommended. I try to spend quite a bit of time each day playing with them, and they have a few toys around that they seem to like playing with often.

Given that I spend most of my time at my computer, I have taken measures for the desk to be cat friendly while still allowing me to work: I have something that goes above the keyboard so that I can type while they sit above it (and it stops them from accidentally typing anything), I have used a desk pole to raise my monitors to the limit of what is comfortable for me to look at so that they can walk in front without stopping me from working, etc. They love to come onto the desk for petting and I am perfectly fine with that.

However, one of the cats sometimes gets fascinated by the mouse cursor (or other small moving objects on the screen) and will occasionally pounce on it. He hasn't used claws yet but I am a little worried for the screens, and also worried that despite my best efforts the monitor setup might dislodge and fall on him if he ever does it with enough force. It's not possible to put the monitors any higher up, so I am considering making him associated negative consequences with this action, though I'm struggling to work out how. So far I have waited until he pounced, then promptly picked him up and put him on the floor, to try and associate the behaviour with being put on the floor... But this seems to bother him very little and doesn't seem to discourage him from doing the same thing again later.

Since the screens are off when I'm not at my desk, this is behaviour that I only expect to see when I'm there to react, so is there something I could do to discourage the behaviour, without hurting him or making him fearful of me? I looked into one of those ultrasonic beepers used to train dogs, but apparently cats aren't really bothered by them, from what I've read.

I have a 5 month old bengal kitten and had him since 10 weeks.

For the most part he is sweet and loving and loves to play. But since we first got him he has chased my other two cats ( 4 year old fixed mixed breed girls)

At first it was a testing of boundaries that would end as soon as it started but now it's getting much worse. Both the girl cats have very gentle nature's, never once have they gone for me or anyone. So now he chases them. Doesn't stop unless you physically take him off the one of the cats.

He isn't fixed yet as we are on the waiting list at the vets but plan to as soon as possible. Can't separate them as that would mean one party would be locked in a single room which isn't fair.

One of the girls in particular he just doesn't stop. Will bite and scratch her and she just tries to get away and screams as she's doing it. She spends most of her time in the window. Eating fine but will just go to the toilet on the windowsill as if she jumps down he will chase her.

He gets a lot of play and has many toys and boredom breakers. We have also closed him in a room when it happens to cool off for 10 minutes and that hasn't helped. Tried feliway diffusers, tried to incorporate all parties in play and treat time. But basically any time we interact with one of the girls he is straight next to you looking for a way to stop it and chase them.

There are options, as in family members could possible take him in but there's a bond now and I believe that is a last resort and not a first one. Just need any advice or stories to give me hope because right now I don't know what to do.

He has come into contact with another male and female when we stayed at a family members house at Christmas. He was fine, he pushed his boundaries with the male cat who put him in his place and he stayed away from the female cat just watching her.

I have a really old, really scared cat that stays under the bed most of the time. We have to replace the bed with one that has no space for her underneath it, and I want to find a way to still give her a safe space somewhere in my apartment.  

----

Hey all,

I adopted a cat last summer, she's an old (10+ at least) scared lady and I do not know what happened to her before she ended up in the shelter.  

All I know is that after a year and a half, she still runs away from me and my girlfriend. She prefers hiding under the bed for most of the day. She used to hide behind a closet, in a really tight space so this is already an improvement.  

 The last few months, she's also starting walking around while we are not moving. Like when we're sitting at our desk, in the couch or in bed. She often sits a few metres away, looking at us, purring, scratching her head on the furniture, looking happy.   

However, as soon as we get up and start walking around, she'll bolt away and go hide under the bed. The only time she comes close to me while I'm moving is when I'm giving her food. However, still no touching allowed and she'll still bolt if I make any sudden movements. When other people are around, she wont come out of under the bed at all.  

Now the reason I'm making this post: my bedframe is broken and we need to replace the bed. We've got a free new one available but this bed has no open space underneath it. So we're planning on waiting until our cat is out of the bedroom, then closing the door and replacing the bed, effectively blocking her favourite hiding spot.  

I'm worried this will take away the only safe space our cat has, stress her out even more and destroy any possibility of ever fully making her adapt to us. It's taken a long time (over a year!) but just seeing her calm and purring while we sit down somewhere makes me very happy already. I don't want to ruin that by making her feel unsafe.  

So my idea was to buy a small cat house, install it in the house a few days before we remove the bed, spray it with some catnip, put some treats in and hope she uses it, feels safe there. So that when we remove the bed, she knows there's another possibility somewhere to hide that she likes.  

Does that sound like a good plan? How much time should we give her? Any suggestions for good cat houses? I'm thinking of one with at least two exits that's pretty big but not too high up (she's old and not very agile anymore). 

But knowing cats and knowing her, there's a high chance she'll just ignore the cat house like she's ignored scratching mats, poles and toys we've bought her. And then we remove the bed and she's scared and in some totally awkward hiding spot again for months on end.

When we was 14 months old, I learned that you don't hit animals and that what I was taught was abuse. I'm from a very poor trailer trash part of the US. So, I stopped hitting him. Instead, if I saw him do something good I gave him a treat. Now, I have anger issues, moderate Autism, RAD, ADHD, ODD and NPD and can be prone to throwing things. Not at him though. Recently, I've noticed that if I move too fast he crouches down like I've scared him. I've also noticed that if I curse in a certain tone that he runs and hides. Three weeks ago I started what I would say are ""cursing sessions"" I would curse in that tone for about twenty seconds and after every time I cursed I gave him a treat. Admittedly he was hiding in his crate but he was still eating the treats. Tonight, he didn't hide but he was about eight feet away while I threw treats. I did this for about two minutes.

She also doesn‚Äôt give a shit about me...Now I get why ppl say that cats suck. I miss my previous kitter.
While she does listen to commands such as ‚Äúno‚Äù and ‚Äúcome here‚Äù she still deliberately does things so that I will give her my undivided attention whenever and for however long she demands. 
She is sweet and not aggressive, she follows me around like a dog and only trills but is also not physically affectionate beyond marking my limbs as her territory with her face. She doesn‚Äôt sleep or sit next to me or on me, just proximal to me.

I also went to the vet several times to exclude health issues.

- stress reduced food
- separate play time 
- always going first to the lady to greet
- feliway classic (not in the bedroom)
- 3 litter boxes - not in the bedroom 
- 2 cat trees in the bedroom

I have 3 cats, and the cat with the behavioral issues turns 3 in April, he is the middle ""child"", Bodhi. All of my cats have always got along extremely well. Greysen is the youngest(2.5), and Finnegan is the oldest(4). They have been living together perfectly fine for 2 years now, and all had proper introductions when they first came home. 

Last night, I half woke up to hissing and growling. I didn't think anything of it, figured they were playing a little too rough as that happens sometimes but not often. This morning I heard more of it so I got up early to investigate and discovered it was Bodhi hissing and growling at the other cats. They get wet food every morning and always go crazy for it, Bodhi is on the counter with me licking the cans every single day without fail, except today. I separated him and brought him in the bathroom while I showered and gave him wet food separately and he ate it, then went behind the washer and growled at nothing. My initial thought was pain. 

Then I decided to test out the other cats. I let Finnegan in, Bodhi was fine. Finn even cleaned him a little and he was okay with this. I let Greysen in, and he is back to hissing and growling. Greysen is acting completely normal, just wants to hang out with his brother. Bodhi is also completely fine with me, he was even snuggling and purring on my lap while I was getting ready and locked the other cats out. 

When I called the vet, they didn't have anything available and are convinced he has a urinary blockage. Greysen gets UTI's sometimes so all 3 cats eat a prescription urinary tract diet (hills), so while it's not impossible, I find it unlikely. They are going to call me later when other doctors get in to see if they can see him. 

I had to go to work so I separated Bodhi with food, water, and a clean litter box and will go home on my lunch to check the box. If he hasn't gone to the bathroom at all, or only peed a little, I plan on taking him to emergency. 

There has been no environmental change, I checked Bodhi over for any wounds or pain when pressing on areas, nothing in my house he could have gotten into (all chemicals are locked up, no flowers, essential oils, ect).

Yukimor,1642451783,s6e5at,0,False,1,"I had to fly out from California to NYC with my cat. He's not a fan of flying, but is usually pretty good about it. Unfortunately, this time, the trip was incredibly stressful for us both, and he wound up pooping then later peeing in his carrier-- something he never did before. I cleaned the carrier as best I could in the moment, but it wasn't enough, especially with the pee. When we got home, he came out smelling of it.

We have no bath. The sink is not big enough for the task. So the only option left was the shower.

So I took him into the shower with me. I didn't want to shower with clothes on, so I went without protection. 

I fully expected to come out a little scratched up. I say ""a little"", because my cat is accustomed to water: he has a water fountain, he likes to hang out in the sink (and doesn't mind it being turned on at a low setting while he's under it), and I've gotten him to sit in a bathtub of water three inches deep and let me lightly rinse him before. He occasionally sticks his head past the shower curtain to check in on me while I'm showering. So he's not afraid of water. But he is sensitive to noise and touch, and I didn't think he'd like the feeling of being pelted with water very much. I was prepared for him to fly out of my arms.

The answer is: he did find it unpleasant, at first. He dug his paws into my shoulder and looked extremely startled, but was careful not to dig his claws into me while doing so, even though he clearly didn't like it. But when he realized the water was warm, and that I was keeping water out of his face, he calmed down. He allowed me to prop him up like a violin, spread out across one arm and my shoulder while I washed him with the other hand. If I had to wet his neck and chest, I used my hand to draw water there. Only his rear and torso were exposed to the actual shower spray. 

He wasn't relaxed, but he was cooperative and calm. The shower probably took all of five minutes. I used no shampoo-- I didn't have any appropriate for a cat on hand, and even if I had, I don't think I would've used it. 

I got out, toweled him off, then took him to my room and parked him in front of the space heater to dry off (and stay warm, since it was freezing in most of the house). Boom, done.

now the problem: once when he was a kitten he peed on the couch. he didn't get down in time and i didn't scold him for it bc well, he is a cat and it was an accident. i didn't need to litter train him in the beginning bc apart from that one incident he has been completely clean. but!!! he keeps peeing on fabric! we talked to the vet, he is healthy, so the vet recommended feliway, but that didn't do anything. it's not a super regular thing for him to pee on fabric, there are times where he pees outside the litter a few times a week and then we go months without an incident.

the setup: 2 litter boxes that get cleaned regularly, they are huge clear ikea boxes with a top in which we cut huge holes. had them uncovered, problem persisted + we had litter everywhere. we put a litter rug down, but he peed on that so we just put the lid back on, litter is the same for over 2 years, and he is allowed to pee in the sink/bathtub (wouldn't even know how to prevent that and he pees directly into the drain and preferably when one of us is peeing as well lol). we play with him, teach him tricks, he is around us all day, has a lot of hiding places and the option to just go to another room and be by himself.

the thing is, it's not anxiety, no health problems, no major changes or just being rude. i noticed he pees when he is CALM and RELAXED. it's like a kink. once i found him sleeping on a rug just a few inches next to where he peed. what a perv. we also tried feeding him in places where he peed, but today he actually peed on a pillow where we always practice our tricks with him and where he sleeps everyday :/ ALSO: sometimes he doesn't bury his poop. don't know if that's related

sueq3rd,1642285678,s4w476,0,False,1,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm looking for some advice. Please redirect me if I‚Äôm in the wrong place. My fianc√© and I have an 11-year-old female blind cat that is having a rough time with us adopting a 1.5-year-old male. Both are fixed. We specifically looked for a submissive, easy going cat since she‚Äôs blind and can‚Äôt really defend herself. We were successful, but she hisses at him every time he gets close to her/sniffs her. He doesn‚Äôt care and walks away whenever she does this, and now even takes a different path in the house to avoid her. We don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs scared, it‚Äôs more out of respect for her space. He‚Äôs never hissed back, growled or swiped at her. He‚Äôs flopped on his back a couple times and exposed his stomach to her, but with her being blind it makes things complicated. We gave him a collar with a bell on it to help her determine where he is, but she still hisses.

Here‚Äôs how we started introducing:

We kept him in our guest bedroom to let him have a safe space. After a few days, we put our female cat in his room to get her used to his scent, and we let him roam and explore the rest of the house. We did this for about an hour or two at a time for a few days. 

We then tried to have them in the same room together. We picked our living room, there were no litter boxes or food so that there wouldn‚Äôt be too much territorial aggression. Everything was fine until he touched her, and that‚Äôs when she hissed. We did this for a couple days and nothing changed. 

We thought it might be a good idea to let him roam the house while we‚Äôre home just so they can both get used to each other being in the same space. She keeps hissing whenever he sniffs her and even when he walks by her. When he meows, she doesn‚Äôt react unless he‚Äôs right next to her. The last few days she‚Äôs also been hissing when she smells him, but he‚Äôs in a different room.

We reward him when he walks away to reinforce the non-aggression. Our girl knows the word ‚Äúno‚Äù so we use that when she hisses. We haven‚Äôt been using a spray bottle on her.

We‚Äôre just not sure what else to do. His only behavioral issues are scratching furniture and jumping up on tables, but that‚Äôs a thing most cats do. He‚Äôs very respectful to her and we‚Äôre just trying to figure out what to do so that they can at least co-exist. Our old kitty is our priority but I‚Äôd like to avoid taking the little boy back to the shelter. He was so shy and quiet when we first brought him home and now he has such a cute little personality and really gets a long with us.   I don‚Äôt want him to start over and be confused.

I'm thinking about getting a cat (probably as a kitten) in the next year or two, after my (tiny) dog matures a bit and we lock some more training in (he likes cats and has been around them for hours to days at a time since pretty much as soon as he came home).

One of the things that has been a big project with my dog is all of the training that is *not* obedience, e.g.,

  * training him to tolerate noisy machines like vacuum cleaners
  * getting him accustomed to car rides
  * working to get him used to spending time in crates or exercise pens
  * potty training
  * introducing him to people and animals
  * making sure he can tolerate being handled at the vet
  * teaching him to be peaceful and calm during grooming (tooth brushing, nail trimming, hair trimming, hair brushing)
  * working on walking well on a leash

and so on. There are a lot of programs out there for this kind of stuff, usually called ‚Äòpuppy socialization‚Äô, and even group classes where you work on things like this alongside basic obedience. I'm wondering:

1. Can cats benefit from programs like that?
2. Do classes on that kind of stuff exist?
3. Are there any important differences that would make reusing material or experiences from my puppy classes harmful or unduly stressful for cats?
  * For example, I think it would be a bit sad to have a cat and keep it indoors all of the time, but I also understand how having outdoor cats is dangerous for them and harmful to local wildlife. Working with a cat on wearing a harness and leash, then, seems like a natural solution that would allow me to take the cat outdoors to see new areas or just to get some sunshine in a way that might be safe for the cat.

I‚Äôm also scared of motorcycles or cars not seeing them or intentionally running them over. I‚Äôm saving up for either airtags or one of those collar cams but for the meantime, I tied them up indoors. I live in a tropical country so doors and windows are always open coz it gets hot af. 

I‚Äôm planning to get a screen door and my windows screened too so I can keep them all inside. I‚Äôm also planning a catio that will connect to my windows so he can have some ‚Äúoutdoor time‚Äù too. But it‚Äôs not gonna happen till maybe April. 

Because they want to roam and get ‚Äúoutdoor time‚Äù and probably because they don‚Äôt like the idea that we have a lot of new kittens from rescue, they‚Äôve gotten aggressive. Would growl and scratch and bite and defo draws blood. I‚Äôm used to getting scratched and stuff but I don‚Äôt want to stress them more than they alrd are.

She can't be unsupervised outside, so I have to go out with her to keep an eye on her while she sits in the garden. The problem is that she wants to go outside all the time. She yowls and scratches at the door constantly, even if I was just outside with her. I don't relent while she's meowing because it's not something I want to reinforce, but man that does NOT stop her.

Now she's decided that if I don't let her outside, she's going to poop in the corner by the door. I know it's because she's upset! I'll hear her meowing by the door, and when I don't come to open it for her, it's followed by the tell-tale sound of her scratching the floor to poop. Just now I heard the scratching and ran to stop her. She dashed away from me to another corner, and IMMEDIATELY squatted to poop. I managed to pick her up and carry her to her litter in time, but doing that is probably upsetting for her.

Need to note that her litter is fresh and tidy! She never had problems using it when she isn't mad.

I think this could be solved by putting a litter tray by the door. But I live with my mum and there's no way she would let me do that, because the door is by the dining table (our house is also small, and there isn't much room for a litter tray there).

Lately the 3F will hiss or even start fights with the 6M unprovoked. At first I thought it was the 6M since he's a bit shy and may be getting defensive too quickly. But I've seen in person twice now him being chill/neutral just walking around or sitting somewhere and the 3F provokes him. We've been reinforcing good behavior with Greenies and so far for negative behavior immediate removal of the provoker into their own room.

Before we started letting them roam (I WFH so nearby to observe) we would put them in the same room together and pet them one with each hand and play string toy evenly. They would groom each other, play/explore together on their own accord and so on. When they first started roaming they would still play, groom, and explore together. But as of yesterday the 3F is just outright mean to him for no reason. They each eat individually with their own bowls, have different water sources and 4 litter boxes, and are spayed/neutered. Should I be doing any other negative reinforcement for the 3F other than isolating? I don't think spray bottles or other physical forms of negative reinforcement are a good idea, but at the same time saying no firmly and removing her hasn't done much.

It's crazy how quickly they can go from rubbing up on each other with their heads, grooming each other, and etc. to her just being flat out mean to him. Otherwise the 3F is very loving, doesn't bite/scratch when getting removed, and know she's wrong but keeps doing this anyways.

We adopted a male kitten about a month ago and he has had a consistent issue with not using his litter box. He will routinely both pee and poop on any available blankets, often blankets on top of people but not always.

Some background. He is almost 2 months old, fixed, and has been to the vet/had a stool sample tested. We have two female cats (both 1.5 years of age) and they all get along great. 

He isn't yet allowed to roam the house without our supervision. The females have always been in the habit of being confined to the basement at night so he is not alone at night when we can't watch him; all three cats go to ""bed"" in the basement and get their food/water topped off.

I clean the litter boxes daily. We have 1 extra large box (an under bed storage container kept in a closet with a cat portal) and a regular litter box. Since the introduction of the regular litter box, all 3 cats prefer that one.

Things we've tried. 

 ‚Ä¢ Litter attractant and physically moving him down to the litter box every hour. Minimal improvements. I often catch him ""digging"" at blankets like they're litter and whisk him off to the box but today that didn't work. He immediately left the box, marched back upstairs to another blanket and peed.

He gets lots of attention, but it's harder to do when he's confined which is why we've been trying the frequent escorted box visit method instead of locking him up. He's an affectionate and playful cat.

nodasani,1641477882,rxfccz,0,False,1,"Hi all, 

Back in august, my cats had a pretty massive throw down (I‚Äôm quite certain they saw a neighbour cat outside, and redirected their aggression at each other). 

We immediately started Jackson Galaxy‚Äôs videos, and after several months and loads of setbacks/feeling like they were plateauing, they‚Äôve gotten to the point where: 

- when not hyper, they can mostly walk past each other without any reaction beyond a light sniff, if that 

- within the last few days, they‚Äôve started voluntarily hanging out together on top of their cat tree. They either sleep side by side in separate shelves, or groom each other and sleep for a short period of time on the same one. This sometimes ends up with them batting or biting at each other, but they were like that before so I just click at them and they stop 

- they play well together when I‚Äôm guiding the play. Previously, if one made a sudden movement, there would be hissing and eye-locking, but this is no longer the case

HOWEVER, when they‚Äôve been awake together for longer than a half an hour or so, one of them inevitably raises a paw, which then leads to wrestling (which seems slightly more intense than play fighting). I always separate them and give treats and pets, but after that point the dynamic devolves. Rooney (my male cat) starts stalking sprout (my female cat), and he‚Äôll start trying to bat at her, and he‚Äôll usually end up lunging with an aggressive meow. At this point I move them to different rooms. 

I know consistency is key, so I‚Äôve continued to do joint play and all of that, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice on how to continue the upward trend, or if they‚Äôve had a similar experience, and what happened next. I was extremely happy when they started grooming each other a few days ago, and kind of hoped that they were back to normal, but it seems as if they‚Äôre just the same as before but now sleep together occasionally.

Ne13ula,1641406402,rwt5nz,0,False,1,"I have a 5 month old cat, and at this point, I have no idea how to deal with her anymore.

To preface, she‚Äôs got all her shots and is spayed. We also have a male cat who is about a year &amp; 7 months old who doesn‚Äôt exhibit any of the behaviors that she does.

The following behaviors have been occurring since we got her and have worsened since:

-Refusal to use the litter box. She knows where it is and how to use it, but she insists on going elsewhere. I‚Äôm 98% sure it‚Äôs not for health reasons because she has specific spots she goes to, and when we block them, she either uses the others or comes up with new ones. The only time she uses the box is if she‚Äôs caught mid-act and it shoved inside.

-Obsession with the trash can. It‚Äôs got to a point where we have to keep a table over the can and two stools around it to keep her from getting in. We have a plastic can we have to manually open, so she taught herself how to open it with her nose enough to get in. If she‚Äôs unable to do that, she‚Äôs also taught herself to knock over the trash can. We‚Äôve tried the method of putting tinfoil on it but she‚Äôs learned that there‚Äôs usually food in it, so she tries to eat it.

-Obsession/aggression with food. We‚Äôre forced to shut her in the bathroom anytime we have food out because she insists on eating at all times. When I mention food aggression, I don‚Äôt mean the traditional sense where she is very defensive of her food. She will shove and claw past us to get to our food regardless of how we try to stop her. If we put her down, she comes right back immediately. If we spray her, she ignores it until like 10-12 squirts. She‚Äôll also eat through soft material if she knows it contains food, including pizza boxes, chip bags, and egg cartons.

-Refusal to understand boundaries. We can‚Äôt close any doors in our apartment because she will claw the hell out of them trying to dig through.

nodasani,1641299428,rvtbit,0,False,1,"Hi all, 

Back in august, my cats had a pretty massive throw down (I‚Äôm quite certain they saw a neighbour cat outside, and redirected their aggression at each other). 

We immediately started Jackson Galaxy‚Äôs videos, and after several months and loads of setbacks/feeling like they were plateauing, they‚Äôve gotten to the point where: 

- when not hyper, they can mostly walk past each other without any reaction beyond a light sniff, if that 

- within the last few days, they‚Äôve started voluntarily hanging out together on top of their cat tree. They either sleep side by side in separate shelves, or groom each other and sleep for a short period of time on the same one. This sometimes ends up with them batting or biting at each other, but they were like that before so I just click at them and they stop 

- they play well together when I‚Äôm guiding the play. Previously, if one made a sudden movement, there would be hissing and eye-locking, but this is no longer the case

HOWEVER, when they‚Äôve been awake together for longer than a half an hour or so, one of them inevitably raises a paw, which then leads to wrestling (which seems slightly more intense than play fighting). I always separate them and give treats and pets, but after that point the dynamic devolves. Rooney (my male cat) starts stalking sprout (my female cat), and he‚Äôll start trying to bat at her, and he‚Äôll usually end up lunging with an aggressive meow. At this point I move them to different rooms. 

I know consistency is key, so I‚Äôve continued to do joint play and all of that, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice on how to continue the upward trend, or if they‚Äôve had a similar experience, and what happened next. I was extremely happy when they started grooming each other a few days ago, and kind of hoped that they were back to normal, but it seems as if they‚Äôre just the same as before but now sleep together occasionally.

I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve found this sub. I grew up alongside dogs and know a lot about their behaviour, the way to train them and so on.. Also, I‚Äôm lucky enough to work in the wildlife and love interact with all kind of animals.

Anyway, last week, on Wednesday I‚Äôve found a kitty on a night walk by the local swamp. This is France here; winter night are pretty cold. Although he was frozen and dying he wouldn‚Äôt let me approach. 
1 hour of patience  later I eventually grab him. He felt instantly better. 
He was starving, freezing and exhausted. Since then he is much much better, I took him to the vet. He‚Äôs all good, according to him he would be somehow 10/12 weeks old. His name‚Äôs Gaspard!

This is my first cat ever! Thus I‚Äôve found this sub, this is insane, I wouldn‚Äôt expect that I could do so much with him.

A few questions:

-When to start?

-What to start with? (The name I guess?)

-Is there any steps to follow? (I‚Äôve read someone who taught his cat to touch his nose if cat wants to get down; is this, among others, some ‚Äòmaster‚Äô tricks?

-I‚Äôve got the fact training works with treats. And then, do the cat will always needs the treat to get the job done?

-I don‚Äôt feel confortable working with treat. What would be the recommandation in order to use them ar a minimum?

-What treats would you recommend?

-I feel like he‚Äôs eating a lot (about 90g a day, which is the max range the food producer suggests. Also, he always try and reach the food as I am eating (even though he got food at usual place, literally 2m away. Any advice? 

Otherwise he LOVES to cuddle and to get pet! He‚Äôs perfectly clean and don‚Äôt really bother me at night. For some reason he loves and destroys only Apple stuff. 

Now he feels better at home,he get more excited. He attacks my feet (fuck this) or bite me the hand; some times pretty hard. 
I‚Äôve read online that I should stop moving and take him somewhere else. Apparently touching his nose, as her mother would do, seems to be efficient with Gaspard. 

I‚Äôve bought toys and play with him as soon as he get excited make him run through the house. It makes the job but he keeps randomly attack my leg (yeah now the whole leg lol.)

It's out of the blue, it can be after petting him, after playing with him, or just completely random as he lies next to someone on the couch or just by walking past him while he's laying down or walking around on the floor. He goes for arms, legs and has gone for both face and throat on some of the younger members of the family. (When they get a bit too comfortable around him). It might be worth mentioning that it's not just an ""I'm annoyed, leave me alone"" warning situation, he goes for blood with teeth and claws at the same time. Last year he had a similar phase from around October - December, where he was straight up unsafe to be around but still didn't go as hard out as he does now, he never went for the face or throat then. This year it's been a lot worse since august until now, late December. He was relatively calm between January until late Summer, with one or two incidents for those six-sever months. He has plenty of toys he plays with frequently too, and that we play with him as well. So It doesn't seem like boredom.

PsychUndergradBb,1640507632,rosxds,0,False,1,"Hi all! This is my first post in this sub so please be gentle!

I just wanted to share how I trained my cat to ask for down/say no/ask for a behaviour of mine to stop. I use mostly positive reinforcement training and psychological principles of behaviour to shape my cat‚Äôs behaviour. She knows a cocktail of tricks such as come, sit, sit pretty, lay down, roll over, stand, jump, jump into my arms, weave between my legs, spin, paw, and up/down from surfaces. My favourite behaviour, however, is the ‚Äúdown tap.‚Äù

So how this looks at the end of the training process is that my cat, Mavis, taps my face gently with a paw to ask for down. Ideally she would tap my nose because she sometimes goes square for the mouth but I never bothered going that far with the conditioning because I love her and it‚Äôs very cute having her caress my face for down lol. My sister‚Äôs cat, though, knows to tap the nose precisely which is a bit less litter-in-the-mouthy. Credit to my sister for inspiring me to teach my cat this important communication!!

So here are the steps I took to teach this behaviour:

1. Pick up cat. Put down cat. Deliver reinforcer; for Mavis, that‚Äôs treats and praise.
2. Repeat step 1 until cat expects the reward for being put down.
3. Start asking for a paw on your face by tapping the treat against your face. This can be easier if your cat already knows ‚Äúpaw‚Äù but it‚Äôs not necessary.
4. ANY movement of paw towards face = put down THEN deliver reinforcer.
5. Gradually raise your standard by not putting down until the paw is closer and closer and eventually touching your face. You can continue all the way to nose if you want!
6. Phase out the treat. Being put down will become the reinforcing consequence!
7. Congratulations, you have a cat who can ask for down!

What I loved about Mavis learning this was that it worked IMMEDIATELY. She no longer squirms to be let down which can be dangerous if she falls, she doesn‚Äôt bite, scratch, or shut down. She can simply communicate her desire to be released! Not only that but the behaviour generalized to other situations, which is why the paw to face also means ‚Äústop‚Äù or ‚Äúno.‚Äù For example, when Mavis chooses to cuddle me (a feat I accomplished by doing ‚Äúcuddle training‚Äù which I can do another post on), she sometimes does NOT want to be pet at the same time. So, instead of getting overwhelmed and running away, she gently smacks my face, I put my hands down, and she resettles, happy to cuddle without pets. It‚Äôs awesome.

Similar note: I always ask for Mavis‚Äô consent before petting her. I shaped her ‚Äúmore pets please‚Äù behaviour by only petting her when she rubs her face against my hand when I present it to her. If she does not rub, I know she doesn‚Äôt want pets, and I don‚Äôt pet. When she does want pets, I continually check in by repeating the hand-face-rub process to make sure she still consents to the petting. This is the antithesis to the ‚Äúdown/stop/no‚Äù behaviour hehe.

MAJINVEGIT0,1640365138,rnq7rv,0,False,1,"Hello,

First time cat owner and first time here so I'm sorry if something like this has been asked before. Like I said I am a first time cat owner, and within the first month of owning my cat I got tired of leaning the liter box everyday. I knew people could train cats to use the toilet and I'd much rather flush cat poop rather than scooping it out of a box.

So I bought the CittiKitty off Amazon as it had very good reviews. I started off with the liter box on the toilet with flushable liter for a week and my cat used it with no issue. The next week I started using the CittiKitty product that goes on the toilet bowl under the seat. She used that for a week with no issue. So after the one week I removed the 1st insert, this is the first time she sees that there is water under it. I follow the training instructions, putting her on the toilet each time something changes to let her know it's ok. So after one week of her trying the product with the first insert remover she's using it like a champ. Half the times she was using it she was going right over the hole and the waste was going into the water. At this point I'm very optimistic, she's going right in the bowl, I'm just flushing half the time.

So after that week I follow pattern and removed the second insert. This is where things started to go down hill. So she took a piss right in the hole into the water, I'm thinking again this is great. Well I go to use the bathroom, and I hear her meowing in the other room, I open the door and she takes off. I finish and walk into my room where I'm greeted with the smell of shit. I walk in and see that she pooped on my bed. So I clean it up and go about my day, I'm thinking I was in the bathroom when she needed to go I may have messed with her mojo. The next day I come home from work (I closed my bedroom door just in case) and find that she pooped on the rug outside of the shower, despite her peeing in the toilet that morning. The next day I had off from work but still woke up around the same time I normally do, I hear her peeing in the toilet (at this point she's regularly peeing directly in the toilet skipping the liter) so I get up, give her a treat and praise her like every other successful bowel movement. Now I was about to go back to bed but realized she's on a routine, so I go to the kitchen getting her food ready when I hear her meowing and think ""oh no, my bedroom door is open"" I run in to see her just starting to poop on the bed, she literally peed in the toilet and then less than 5 minutes she poops on my bed.

So no I have her only able to go into three rooms for the time being, the living room, bathroom and kitchen. In the kitchen is her water and in the living room is her two food bowls for wet and dry food (I read somewhere that they don't like to poop in the rooms their food and water is in). So now I'm hoping with nothing else for her to poop on in the bathroom that she will resort to using the toilet.

I'm hoping someone here has some advise or experience they can provide to me, again in short I'm on the 2nd portion of the CittiKitty being removed, she's pees in the toilet without a problem but won't use it to poop.

I live in a house where we have a shared garden between 3 houses. One cat is grey the other black. We think the black cat has been neutered. 

The cats are owned by the Neighbors and they are generally ok. However every once in a while, as I am leaving my own house, going around and the garden, the black cat hisses at me and shows his teeth! He seems to get aggressive as if the fact that he‚Äôs using my garden to sleep with his buddy (which they often do) means I can‚Äôt traverse my own space in my own garden.

Now - when I moved in months ago they were very Beggy - the gray cat could spend 12 hours a day (not kidding) just meowing by the window. To stop this behaviour I must confess I bought a water pistol and started spraying him. This really worked and they don‚Äôt beg anymore.

kittykatzt,1640160694,rm0iu6,0,False,1,"Hello, my boyfriend has a 4.5-5 month old kitten living with him. And the kitten is excessively biting everyone and everything. He tried everything, never playing with his hands and the kitten has a lot of toys and he is always playing. 

When he first told me about it I said ""Must be classic kitten behavior."" because my cat was a little wild when he was a kitten. But after seeing him and witnessing his excessive biting I am really worried. Because the kitten has to learn that it is not okay to bite everyone that enters the house and it is putting a lot of stress and press on his owner. When told this to a vet they're always saying it's ""normal kitten behavior"" but I think it is more than that. So how can we try to train him not to bite? Because I believe that maybe the kitten didn't get the training from his mom about biting and that's why he is always biting anything. Thanks in advance!",CatTraining,5 m.o kitten excessively biting

About 5 months ago, I moved in with them, bringing my 2 cats along. Both of my cats are friendly, outgoing, and well socialized with cats and dogs. Their cat seemed more reserved and fussier. The first time I met their cat, long before moving in, he swatted at my face. I assumed I just came on too strong, but now I see that this is just his normal behavior. I normally ignore him and only pet him when he comes for attention and stop when he loses interest. He always responds to things that upset him with an attack using full claws and teeth. He seems to be triggered by being touched when he is stationary, having someone brush by him while walking, being picked up or examined, and most upsettingly - any time you move if he is sitting on your or near you. 

Today, he bit the back of my head and severely scratched my ear. This attack was triggered by me shifting my weight while sitting next to him on the couch. We were not touching, and I had not pet him or given him any acknowledgment. The last time he attacked, he growled and swatted at my leg for shifting my weight while we were sharing space on the bed. Again, we were not touching, and I had not pet him.

He responds this way to everyone, including the family that raised him from kittenhood, other familiar people, the vet, and guests. According to my partner, he's always been a jerk and has just gotten increasingly more moody with age. He doesn't seem to mind or interact with mt cats and is used to their presence now. He has several litter boxes, toys, high places, food ans water bowls, and hiding spots. We also started using pheromone collars on all of the cats. It seems to have made him more likely to seek out pets, but he's still a jerk. He is also an indoor/outdoor cat ans can get away for alone time when he wants. He has a clean bill of health from a recent vet check-up. No signs of pain, joint issues, or neurological problems. He really just seems like a finicky jerk that wasn't handled enough as a kitten. 

At this point, im thinking he needs a trip to the behavior vet for psychoactive meds and some handling desensitization. I don't think his behavior will get worse, but I hate that I have to worry about being attacked. Am I on the right track?

iheartanimorphs,1640050890,rl2xig,0,False,1,"I recently introduced a three month old kitten to my resident 2.5 year old cat, following Jackson Galaxy's process. It took about four weeks but before a recent trip, they were able to handle being in the same room without hissing or (aggressive) fighting, would eat their meals next to each other without issue, etc. My older cat even started reciprocating whenever the younger kitten wanted to play, he would chase the kitten around the house whenever they both had the zoomies, they would play fight without it ending in hissing, etc. Basically they were getting along as well as I could hope for.

Recently I went out of town for like four days and my sister watched them at my place, but she definitely didn't keep up with my routine of playing/feeding them treats together to maintain a positive association. She told me that while I was gone, my older cat started hissing at the younger cat randomly, like if the kitten just approached him and didn't do anything.

Since I've been back, the older cat has had diarrhea every day and is randomly yowling and crying. He is visibly stressed out by the kitten whenever they are in the same room, although they are fine if I'm playing with both of them or feeding them treats. The older cat gets pretty bad separation anxiety from me, and he also had a recent vet visit right before my trip which I think only added to the stress. 

I've started separating them whenever the kitten is getting on the older cats nerves. I think separating them more frequently is helping, but I feel bad putting the kitten in a room by himself when he's starting to get really attached to me (and the older cat). I'm wondering if it would make sense to just take a huge step back in the cat introduction phase, keeping them separate except for play time and meals and going back to the routine I was following early on, swapping rooms and all that.

We have a bald sphynx female cat. Overall I'm going to be upfront it seems like this is just a bad, high maintenance moody cat. I've had pets before, this cat seems to have an attitude where if something doesnt go her way she is mad. The cat is overly cuddly and seems to like everyone in the family.

spllchksuks,1639832749,rj74eo,0,False,1,"Maybe ‚Äúnight training‚Äù isn‚Äôt the correct phrase but basically, we‚Äôre trying to teach Mister Tibbs, our 3 yr old rescue that we just got 3 weeks ago, good night time behavior (ie staying off the furniture he‚Äôs not allowed on, not meowing for attention, not knocking over objects for attention, etc.)

As I said, we‚Äôve only had our cat Mister Tibbs for 3 weeks so hopefully there‚Äôs time to teach him good habits. When he first arrived, he surprisingly took to us like a duck to water. Very friendly, loves to hang out with us but no separation anxiety, loves getting pets, etc. I feel like we‚Äôve had him for ages instead of 3 weeks.

He was also a pretty good sleeper and only woke up 2x a night (first time around 2-4am to whine for food or because he wanted to play and then again at 5:30am-6am for breakfast, which is when my husband would wake up and feed him before he goes to work). He sleeps in our bedroom (where we keep his litter box, cat bed, toys, food and water bowls), and leave the bedroom door open.

This week, Mister Tibbs has woken us up almost every two hours with the bad behaviors described.

I WFH so I do play with him through the day and we do pre-bedtime playtime and feed him before bedtime so he would ideally be tired and full at night. But in reading articles and this sub, I have now realized that indulging his 2am-4am playtime demands, we have inadvertently taught him that if he wants attention at night, here‚Äôs how to do it. (And I want to note re: the furniture he‚Äôs definitely getting on the ‚Äúforbidden furniture‚Äù for attention because he‚Äôs not much of a climber and during the day, he likes to chill out on certain furniture and ignores the ‚Äúforbidden furniture‚Äù‚Äô completely).

So we know we need to stop responding to him and as I write this, the little man got on my husband‚Äôs desk and knocked some things over but I kept typing on my phone and he calmed down and came to chill out on the bed so it looks like ignoring is going to work!

Now I just have the following questions:

-How do you stay strong and resist the urge to get up and correct your cat? Lol I‚Äôm having a hard time keeping still because I worry that we might end up teaching him that it‚Äôs okay to get on the forbidden furniture? Or should we just accept that all furniture is his now and hide the breakables lol?

-About how long did it take for the ignoring the work and your cat stop or slow down bad nighttime behavior?

-Should we leave the room if he acts up or just try to fall back asleep? I‚Äôm a fairly light sleeper and some nights I‚Äôm tempted to sleep on the couch but I wonder if it‚Äôll count as ignoring or if it‚Äôll upset him since he‚Äôs still relatively new and adjusting?

-Should we keep the bedroom door open or closed during this process? We leave it open so he can wander the apartment if he gets bored but he usually either goes to the kitchen to whine for food or jump on the hall console table and tries to knock things over.

We‚Äôve had him since he was 2 weeks old and as a result he isn‚Äôt afraid of much in the human world. He is a singleton. He will go to strangers and doesn‚Äôt run away when he hears loud noises.

Now, one of them will only use the litterbox sometimes. He has NEVER consistently used the litterbox in my care - he had a bacterial gut infection when I got him and had diarrhea so I attributed his inconsistent use to that, but now he only goes:

1. By himself sometimes for both pees and poos (though he has also peed in the box then immediately stepped out and pooped right next to it).
2. When he sees his brother about to use the litterbox, he will go in with him and they‚Äôll do their business together.

The above happen maybe 1/4 of the time, the other times he will try to go mostly right next to the litterbox but sometimes just wherever he happens to be at the time.

Exmaple-Core,1639497316,rgago9,0,False,1,"My cat, Onyx, has a fierce desire to go outside which can not be extinguished. She is a 3 year old Arabian Mau which is otherworldly persistent

I will divide this post into 3 cat-egories: Her behavior, probable causes of said behavior and what I‚Äôve done and am doing to solve this issue 

!Her behavior!

Onyx will spend mostly all waking hours yowling around the door regardless if people are present. Any type of talking to her (normal, firm, gentle voices, ect) makes her believe that we will give her the outdoors she desires and she meows like a machine gun and circles up the door thinking that any attention you give her is confirmation that she will be getting outside. When I try to leave the house she will press her body to the door to try to slip out. I have to squirt her with water to make her leave and pay close attention to the door when I exit and return home. Onyx has not gotten out on me in more than 6 months. Despite her knowing I will never let her out she keeps trying

Onyx tries to manipulate people in opening the door for her. The ***only*** times she interacts with anyone in the house is to be cute and get them to pet her. She instantly purrs and guides people to the door, stretches her body and taps her paw on the door nob and cries to be let out. If you walk away from the path to the door, she impedes your path with her body, screams and bites ankles for about 5 paces, then hisses with much anger and leaves. I tried letting her lead me to the door, talking to her affectionately and petting her there and not opening it, but once she realizes that she isent going out she gets mad and screams/growls/hisses and leaves. She won‚Äôt let me touch her for a while after

Onyx will Yowl all day and all night. We can‚Äôt exist in the house during the day to focus on bills or relax without her constant yowling at the door and we can‚Äôt sleep because she does the same thing at night. It‚Äôs horribly non stop

When she‚Äôs able to slip out on my grandmother, she will be gone for a couple days and only return to eat. After hastily swallowing her food within 90 seconds or less Onyx immediately tries to get back out and is particularly aggressive with hisses and scratching at the door. She is even more single mindedly focused and mean. It is so nice being able to live without constant noise while she is gone though

She also hates the 2 cats she lives with. Onyx was an only child for 5 months, I adopted her as a kitten after a period of active duty service. She was great too! Then a kitten came into the house via grandmother and another later. She hates them with every fiber of her being despite them leaving her alone at all times. Onyx will go out of her way to attack them and hiss and then leave the area.

!Probable Causes!

Grandmother let‚Äôs her out sometimes. She can‚Äôt help it, she‚Äôs old and can‚Äôt always fight the cat successfully. Refusing to accept the other cats probably is a thing too. That‚Äôs all I can think of.

!My Solutions!

I have tried giving her reasons to choose indoor life with me over being alone out there. I‚Äôve tried enriching her environment with toys, tastes treats, cat nip, warm cozy beds, taking off work to give her extra attention and play time and being generally very good to her. I invest personal 1 on 1 time and keep the other cats off her things

!Conclusion!

I am missing work, sleep, patience and peace of mind listening to her fully automatic yowling. I‚Äôm getting headaches and I miss the friend I had before she changed.

ElFuddLe,1639490901,rg89sf,0,False,1,"I adopted a stray cat recently and he's wonderful, except he's like an opera singer reincarnated. Especially in the mornings. 

I've read some tips online like:  
Ignore him  
Don't feed him until he's quiet  

But these tips assume your cat ever stops meowing. This morning he started at 5 AM and went until 7 with me trying my best to ignore him the whole time. The second problem is I don't know how to feed him without making him feel like he's being rewarded. If I pull out his food, he starts meowing. I can wait 5-10 minutes and he won't stop the entire time. At some point, I have to leave for work. I try my best to only give it during a break in his meows but I can't believe this ca t hasn't lost his voice. 

Part of the problem is that it's not just food. Often times after a meal he'll walk around the house meowing just for the hell of it. 

I consider myself pretty good with animals. I've trained dogs before. I trained my cat to use his scratching post instead of my furniture with positive reinforcement. I play with him regularly to help him burn energy and feed him at consistent intervals. But I feel helpless in the face of his incessant meowing.

TheHolyFlipper,1639468145,rg2fdy,0,False,1,"So... 2 years ago this kitten came up to me on the street and I decided to adopt him such as he was all alone and was following me, I just couldn't leave him there. I think that he was about 2 or 3 months old when I found him. I named him Orion and he became my best friend ever since.
The thing about him is that he always used to attack me when he felt like playing. I've tried all kinds of tips and tricks from the Internet like leaving the room when he starts biting and scratching or rewarding him whenever he behaves but nothing seems to work. In the first couple of months I had him it was more bearable such as he would let me trim his claws but after a while he became more and more aggressive whenever I try this. 
Around the age of 6 months old he started couching pretty badly. When I took him to the vet, again, he was very aggressive towards the vet and we always ask for him to be put in a cage whenever we take him there. I found out he has asthma and I take him monthly for checkups and treatment. He also attacks other people and acts aggressive towards them whenever I bring friends over and shortly after I also found out that he has separation anxiety such as he always refused to eat when I used to go away and my relatives fed him. 
He used to be the most loving kitten and as he grew up he got more and more aggressive. I neutered him but his aggression never stopped. 
I love Orion and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or if this is how he is or if he acts like this because he is sick. In the last months when he attacks me he's scratching and biting me so bad that I start bleeding and I don't like keeping him in other rooms too much. He always sleeps with me and we are together most of the day when he behaves.

But for a few weeks now, he is super uninterested in his toys when he has his zoomies, even his favorite teaser. Sometimes he punches a few times after it, but that's it. He just keeps on running through the flat like crazy, jumps onto places he's not supposed to be at (and he knows that because when we look at him, he will directly jump off) or scratches the wall (instead of his scratching tree). 

I feel bad for him. Of course it also annoys me, but I feel like he might be frustrated and have too much pend up energy to handle. I really wanna help him get this energy out, but as I said, he ignored play attempts when we try.

Dumbest_Smart_Person,1638977739,rbtx4l,15,False,12,"I live in a single family home by myself. I have two cats. They are both named after search engines. The older one is Google (Tabby) and the younger one is Yahoo(Manx). I work 9-5 about 15 minutes away from home.

  
I have had Google for about 5-6 years. Barring some small incidents, he is a very well behaved and social cat. He loves attention, and gets it whenever he wants. He doesn't scratch furniture, and any behavior that wasn't ideal got him a time out growing up. By 1 year old he had exhausted what my girlfriend and I call the ""crackhead state"" where he would do anything for attention, including the things that got him a time out; although that state would only come out if I was tied up in work and couldn't play with him for a day or two. He learned quickly what was okay in the house, and objects (toys, scratching posts, cat shelves) were his.

Enter Yahoo. Yahoo was not a shelter cat, but was found on the street as a kitten with a very large umbilical hernia, probably abandoned. I took him in and my GF and I got him fixed up and healthy. He does not show any signs of discomfort from the procedures, and has been neutered. He is a little over a year old. He is on his last round of kitten food and will be transitioned to adult food starting this week. This cat is in a permanent crackhead state. 

Luckily, Yahoo does not tear up furniture, he does not yank down curtains, and he doesn't claw up anything other than scratching posts; we managed to train that behavior correctly. But he can not calm down for even 1 second when we are home. I have exhausted every product, toy, and method of getting his energy out that I can. He learned how to play fetch, so we play fetch for about an hour every evening, but he doesn't get tired. We often try other methods of play other than fetch while I'm doing chores around the house. I've set up lots of automated laser pointers in the house, distributed toys everywhere, and have plenty of high places for him to perch and jump around to keep him busy while I'm at work. I've tried feliway, I've tried calming collars, pretty much everything except medication. But he persists. 

There are two behaviors that I really don't like, that get him at time out. These behaviors are constant:

1. He will frantically go after anything that remotely looks like food, even if it is not his. You can't take his focus off of it. I have tried isolating him while we eat, but as soon as he is back out again he can't contain himself. I can't bring a bag of chips down to the couch without being on the lookout for stray noses trying to access it, or a frantic dash towards the object in question. I have to feed both cats at the same time, in separate rooms, else Yahoo will quickly eat all his food, go attack Google to make him move, and then scarf down all of Google's food. He's starting to get so frantic that when I start filling up his food bowl, he will attack me or try to knock the food over while I'm filling it so that he can get faster access to it. He now waits in the hall while I fill his bowl. I give him plenty of food twice a day.

2. He will attack anything that moves, is laying around, or remotely looks like he can push it. Toys, Google, game controllers, my toes, you name it. I don't put him in time out for this that often, unless he starts scaling my bookshelves to go after some something he shouldn't, or he attacks something that is very obviously not a toy (my headphones, for example). He has trouble learning what is his and what is not. I have roughly 50 toys he can play with, they all are a specific style that he likes (little plush mice, mostly) and I keep 10 or so out throughout the house for him to play with.

The only thing I did differently training Google was clicker trained him to learn to sit, stay, lay down, and go to a designated spot. I tried starting Yahoo on clicker training but he can't hardly focus, if I get out a treat bag to get his attention he doesn't look at me, he just frantically starts searching a fifty foot radius of my feet hoping that I've already dropped a treat, and does non-stop. I've waited 15 minutes for him to look up and he can't figure it out. I gave up on clicker training for now, hoping he would calm down a little as he got older.

She has no collar, and when we first saw her a bit thin, so we assumed she was a stray.

This cat (we've named her Sundae since then) absolutely loves playing in my grandma's garden, which is one problem of its own, but the thing is Sundae also really likes following us everywhere we go, and that means following us into the house. 

Of course, my grandma is livid about the entire situation, but thanks to her lifelong No Pet policy we have absolutely no idea how to deal with this situation. Currently we just keep the doors closed tight so Sundae can't get in (we live in Malaysia, the door is usually open for everyone) but every once in a while someone forgets and she bolts into the house to play.

RolyPolyCat,1638929318,rbfud4,20,False,19,"My apologies for a long story in advance.

S = Sam
E = Everest

We got E first as a kitten. Skittish and high alert but otherwise sweet, little, weird cat. Two older cats didn‚Äôt want to play so we got S (who was about the same age and neutered) from the ARL, and thought it would be good because someone had adopted S‚Äôs sister but not him. E loved S, they‚Äôd play, sleep together etc. 
S would bully the older cats but we started using Feliway and it stopped more or less. 

Then last June, my partner and I moved into an apartment. We brought S who enjoyed it but kept looking/meowing for E. E was too freaked out the first time so we took her back to my mom‚Äôs and waited to bring her back until the apartment was set up and smelled more like us. Second time was a success and E was happy and S was happy to have E home.

Now S is nonstop going after her to‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶play maybe? He stalks her, jumps on her, pulls out her fur, stares her down, etc. 
It‚Äôs to the point where E is missing a huge chunk of her fur on her back legs. 

We give them plenty of love both together and separately. We play with them a lot. We use the same Feliway as before. We‚Äôve even tried using the expensive ‚Äúcalming‚Äù food. Separate food, water and litter. Nothing seems to work. I am at my wit‚Äôs end. 

Normally I can solve any cat behavior but not this time. I thought we could probably get a couple more higher up hidey holes but we are limited in what we can do since it‚Äôs an apartment.

Any advice?

yeg_sleep,1638924769,rbeaim,10,False,3,"Hello, 

Our 5 year old cat named ""Cub"" is a grazer/free-choice eater, that is to say, he eats his food when he's hungry and *never* over-eats. This is ideal.

Recently we got a 6 month old rescue named ""Dampy"" who basically eats all of his food (and Cub's if he can get at it) as quickly as possible.

Is there a way to get Dampy to be a grazer/free-choice eater, like Cub, without eating ALL of the food at once?

It kind of sucks because Cub now doesn't eat as much because we have to hide all the food while Dampy is at large in the house and Cub doesn't really like eating on a schedule as he is used to just grazing. Cub is losing weight.

Leriliana,1638912492,rb9zxm,6,False,3,"So I have been researching kitten care, especially the biting and encouraging positive behaviour, but I struggle with actually applying it. My kitten is around 3 months old, and recently I had to move him back to my hometown.

Long story short, found him in my hometown, couldn't keep him home, because my parents were completely against it, I lived with him in my dormitory, now they are kinda okay with the idea, so I bought him here.

The biting problem though is not anything new. He bites me most and doesn't listen to me at all, while he behaves very well (doesn't bite as much and actually takes no from my parents and grandma), while I try to do the same and set boundaries, he can not care less about that.

I tried the ""no"" telling for months now, nothing came out, researched and found one specific noice, which imitates that of the mother's cat, did not work either, I stopped playing with him the moment he  bites me, he comes back to just, bite me more. I put him in different room to stop playing time, right now as I am writting this, he is closed in the bathroom, hitting himself in the door to go out, now he is meowing to go out.

I don't know what to do.

He has been terrible yesterday and today, biting with such aggression.

Edit: I forgot to add that he does not only bite my hands, but feet, face and pretty much everything he comes in contact with. He also loves jumping on me while I sleep and as I already mentioned it's nothing new, but now it's more than before and harder, maybe because he is getting bigger.

I really need help. I told my parents I could do it, and I tried my best to train him, but was always interrupted by someone who was always like ""omg he is so cute, he is biting"" literally putting their hands into his mouth.

TLDR is my cat appears to miss her litter box frequently (only in her litter box cabinet) when she pees resulting in a mess around the litter box  


Story: My gf and I bought a house with two floors, and we have a cat, black shorthair formally feral cat, super affectionate but super sketchy - \~8 years old, owned for 3 years. Since moving into this house we had her litter on the main floor laundry room, but she would routinely poop outside her litter. We figured given her sketchiness and her affinity for upstairs maybe she was not making it to the laundry room in time or freaked out by the machines/kitchen she has to pass on the way to it. So we put a second litter upstairs and housed it in an old bench-cabinet thing (pictured).   


And Voila no more poop on the floor.  


However...She now seems to miss her box in her cabinet. She's always peed on the edge of her litter (we witness this, her standing in the door way peeing), but now she full on misses. At first  we had a litter mat with a little dribble on it, and we thought (maybe she peed on the edge and it ran up over the rim of the bottom part), so we added a boot mat underneath to catch dribble. Then it was a bigger puddle, so we thought maybe the litterbox is too small and bought her a longer topless box for her to use. But today it was a full piss on the boot mat. I saw where she started by the residue, and she full on peed on the front outside of the box , not even in the litter.   


So I'm pretty pissed, no pun intended. Is the cabinet too long, that maybe she thinks she is just in her litter? Should I get a new cabinet that's shorter? Is there anything I can do to convince her to go deeper into her litter?

Lately I've been feeling stuck and training time is slowly becoming rote / too easy. He's a cat full of energy who gets bored fast and could use more challenge. What Im having a hard time doing is introducing anything new. The tricks he knows were easy to ""explain"" to him, and I can't think of how to move onto tricks that require more steps. I think Stay or Wait or go on Mat would be useful to learn, but I can't figure out how to break these down to teachable bits. I also don't know how to make it so that the command to go IN (plastic carrier) can be expanded to go IN his soft bag carrier. He refuses to go in there on command, even to follow the target, despite the fact that it's a comfort spot for him. Similarly, I keep reading that it should be easy to go from shake to wave, or from sit to stand, but HOW? Im clearly missing something obvious here.

What he knows so far: TARGET with his nose (though still regularly tries to cheat with a paw, bc cat I guess). SIT on vocal command alone. TURN (by following the target plus vocal command). SHAKE with his right paw, and shake OTHER with his left paw. This last one took us easily a month and a half - even hungry he would look at me, understand what I want (I offered the other hand), and go and sit one meter away with his back at me, his sign that he doesn't agree with this command. He did resentfully come back if I waited long enough tho, lol.

From daily life he also clearly knows (but obvs doesn't consistently follow): NO, CMON (we take short walks on a leash cause apartment cat), DOWN, and IN (carrier). He gets praise or treats for these, depending on situation.

So, my kitten (Yara) has been much better with biting since we got her around 3 months ago when she was just 5 months old.

However she does still do a lot of communicating through bites. Most of this might be love bites? 

The most common scenarios of this happening (there are multiple):

- Whenever she asks for pets when I come home or wake up, she will meow and purr up a storm and then gently bite whatever one of my body parts is close to her. After I withdraw and walk away, she either goes about her day or she‚Äôll just, confusingly, follow me for more pets. 

- similarly, she will meow to be picked up and begin purring and chilling until she wants to be put down. Even when she can clearly jump off of me, she will bite me until I put her down. 

- Very recently (the past week or so), she‚Äôs gotten into the habit of burrowing under the blanket in the morning, and then biting me after around 5 or so minutes? I feel like this is her wanting me to get up and play with her. 

It‚Äôs become much more gentle and tolerable than before but it‚Äôs still kind of confusing to me why she does it or how I can break the habit.

Some things I‚Äôve tried to varying levels of success are:

- I always make sure to give her a TON of playtime everyday with toys exclusively. Maybe like several one hour play sessions. What I‚Äôm only just starting to do now is to develop a schedule with predictable playtimes, so hopefully that gives her a little more to work with . 

- Every time her teeth make contact with skin I put her down, give her a toy and walk away. But the thing is, she keeps following me, rubbing up against me and asking for more pet despite me ignoring her.

- I‚Äôve tried yelping loudly or a high pitched ‚ÄúOW‚Äù, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to make a difference. 

- I‚Äôve tried putting her in the bedroom with all her things for 5 minutes at a time, but I don‚Äôt really know if this has been doing much. 

- were moving in a month or two to a bigger place, and hopefully by then we can get another cat so she has a playmate and can burn off the extra energy that I can‚Äôt keep up with.

- were scheduling to get her spayed soon, probably after the Christmas break

We had no significant problems. The cats got along decently up until now, they just ignore each other. 

My roommate's cat (let's call her Fluffy) is still very young and energetic. Fluffy is basically a ball of  pent up energy; her owner is rarely home and doesn't play with her very often. She darts around all the time, tries to play with the other cats (they all reject her, she has poor social skills), and in general has a lot of compressed energy. I've been home more often in the last month and have noticed that Fluffy likes to dart out and use her hand to bat at my cat when she is walking by or has her back turned. My cat, understandably, hates this, but Fluffy doesn't seem to respond to her correction -- instead, she starts growling too, and a fight breaks out. Even after my cat decides to diffuse a potential fight by turning her back and walking away, Fluffy doesn't take the hint and attacks her the instant her back is turned. There's been two fights in the last few days that I've had to interrupt. My cat now has a scratch on her eye; she is half of Fluffy's size. Fluffy seems no worse for the wear and her ambushing seems to be escalating if anything; the doors to our rooms are literally 1 foot apart.

Temporary_Coyote,1638459184,r7a04a,4,False,1,"Hi everyone.

my partner has a cat named Princess. She's beautiful and a very cool cat, but we've experienced a lot of behavioral issues lately. This is starting to affect our relationship and I would love some feedback/ways to be the best cat mom i can be. Thank you in advance.

Background:

My partner and I have been together for a year, and he has had her for 4 years. Up until we started dating, they have been together exclusively with no one else in the house. He was working from home for a while during the peak of early COVID and spent a lot of time with her at home. He has since gone back into the office full time.

I have experience with raising my own cats/dogs/etc. and I love animals. I know how different cats are from dogs (and how important it is to treat them as such) and have been around different cats with different personalities, but I can safely say, I've never met a cat like her.

Initially, she was relatively warm towards me. (which is rare, because she's cold towards everyone except my partner. She attacks guests or hides under the bed). She would let me pet her and would often lie on me, snuggle with me, flop to show her belly, etc. However, recently, my partner and I have had so many sleeping issues that were caused by her boisterous behavior at night (clawing at the window shades, zooming, meowing, cleaning herself, jumping on us, etc.). He decided it was best to keep her outside the room at night. As you can imagine, she did not like this.

When we closed the door, she would hiss, growl, scratch and wreak overall havoc until we opened the door. It was just as boisterous as before. We tried everything:

* taking her on walks to tire her out before bed
* playing with her extensively before bed
* giving her lots of love and cuddles and positive reinforcement
* giving her a safe place in another room with her litter box, toys, food, water, bed, scratch post
* introduced cat nip to her as a reward for being good

But she would still attack the door. Next, we decided to give her her own bedroom and close the door. Every single night, we give her a ton of love and pets and wear her/give her treats before ""tucking her in"" and closing her bedroom door. It seems to work great. She sleeps well (we have a camera) and only meows for a few minutes before falling asleep/playing/eating/etc.

However, ever since then, she has become EXTREMELY aggressive towards me and me alone. I completely understand that sometimes a cat doesnt wanna hang out or be touched and despite that, she will come up to me and rub against me and nudge her head against my hand (what she usually does to ask for pets), once I do, she bites/swats/hisses. I'll be opening her bag of food and she'll be in another room and she'll come out of nowhere and attack. I'll be cleaning her litter box and she'll come from the next room over and attack.

I'm at my wits end and I don't want to feel like I can't be comfortable in my own home (I'm moving in to his house in March). Please help. I am up for anything and love this cat and want to make it work. Thanks so much.

justempathetic,1638361008,r6dgmc,3,False,1,"TLDR; Seven month old litter box trained kitten spent a few days away from home, came back to every surface, wall, and floor cleaned top to bottom and our roommate moved out and now no matter how many times we reprimand him or make his favorite spots unavailable, he insists upon urinating everywhere except his litter box which he never had a big issue with before.

About a week ago I sent my two cats, Oliver, age unknown since we found him in a parking lot but probably around 1.5 to 2.5 years, and Jasper, around seven months old, to my mom‚Äôs house for four days during our apartment‚Äôs inspection period. I fully trust they were treated well and not much differently than at home. 

While they were gone I cleaned our carpets with two kinds of pet stain remover that claimed to help prevent resoiling (which I had never used before, so I‚Äôm wondering if maybe this has to do with the smell of that).

Once we were clear to bring them home my mom brought them over and ever since, Jasper has had a HUGE issue unlike ever before with urinating on everything except his litter box (as well as climbing as high as he possibly can like on top of the TV and stuff like that??? Anyways.). He has no issue defecating in it but it‚Äôs like he holds his pee for the second I accidentally leave my bedroom door open, and runs in to crouch on the bed and pee. He‚Äôll do it in any off limits spot he can find (like he doesn‚Äôt do it in the hallways or bathtub but he‚Äôll stop in front of wherever you‚Äôre at and do it on/in front of the bed/couch) and he stops the moment you spray him with water, pick him up, or even sometimes just make eye contact.

He didn‚Äôt ever have a problem with this before we sent him over but since he‚Äôs gotten home, he‚Äôs just been generally extremely defiant. Oliver is the same as always, maybe calmer, or maybe it just seems that way with Jasper‚Äôs newfound rowdiness. 

I also feel that it is important to mention that our roommate just moved out within the past week and she and him were pretty close, but she‚Äôs been gone this long before and he‚Äôs never had this kind of reaction to her not being home so I don‚Äôt think her moving out and us moving furniture into that room would be a big enough stressor to trigger this, but hey, could be separation anxiety?

mifflinite01,1638305688,r5x69z,2,False,1,"Hello! I apologize(times 1000) in advance as this is going to be a looooong read but I feel the background  information is important. My partner and I have a cat. She is a neutered, 7 years old, DSH and we adopted her from our local shelter when she was 3 months old. Her name is Sansa. 

Background on her: she is extremely loving to my partner and I. We have never had an issue with her showing aggression TOWARDS US. However, not the same can be said about other animals or people. 
With other people- she takes time to warm up to them. She will smell them or observe from afar. If she does allow them to pet her it can only be very quickly or she gets overstimulated then attacks. She typically pats/swats their hand and/or hisses. Thankfully nothing more serious. 
With other animals- she lunges at them and attacks! We had an incident where in an emergency a family member had to stay with us and they too had a cat. The family member was only staying for 3 days so we planned to keep the cats completely separate. We did this more because of Sansa than the other cat. The other cat had already lived with other animals with no issue. One day Sansa escaped the room while the other cat was roaming the house (we took turns so they both weren‚Äôt just trapped in one room all day.) Sansa attacked on sight. She ran up to the other cat, grabbed it, and did a somersault with it all in the matter of seconds. The other cat did not fight back he ran straight to his room and hid under the bed. Sansa chased him the entire way, luckily we were able to close the door before she entered the room. 


Now. 

We adopted a dog. She is a mini smooth doxin named Mochi. She is 8 months old and also neutered. We adopted her when she was 6 months. We cannot get Sansa to cohabitate peacefully with Mochi. For reference Mochi does extremely well with other animals and people. 

What we‚Äôve done/tried: 
1)Smells only. We started with this. We swapped blankets and toys so they could smell one another prior to face-to-face. 
2)Feeding time. We feed them together but with a door separating them so still no face to face. 
3)After 2 weeks of that, we tried face to face feeding. Sansa tried attacking. Thankfully Mochi was lifted off the floor before Sansa got her. 
4)We got a pet playpen that has mesh so they can see each other but not touch. We incorporated this a month in. We do it with strict supervision. Sansa tried attacking the first few times. Each time we stopped and tried again the next day. One day Sansa finally stopped attacking within seconds of seeing Mochi. Sansa would stare intensely at Mochi sometimes she would attack other times no. If Mochi moved Sansa would attack (even if she was just switch laying positions). We put Sansa in the playpen and Mochi could not have cared less that she was in there. She saw Sansa and just continued about her normal routine of playing like if Sansa were put away. 

Sansa and Mochi have separate rooms - their ‚Äúsafe‚Äù space and where they also sleep at night. The doors have a pretty big gap at the bottom so Sansa often stalks Mochi under the door. Sansa has also tried attacking him by sticking her claws under the door.


Any tips and tricks to help Sansa in this process? Anything else we can incorporate? 
Getting rid of Sansa or Mochi is NOT an option by any means.

My girlfriend and I have two 3 year old cats, male and female twins, who generally get along very well. They are friendly most of the day and play together quite well, but they sometimes get into nasty fights during the night. Typically it's the brother cat (who is quite a bit larger) attacking and biting fur out of the smaller sister cat. They usually only fight at night (usually after 1am!).

mysha39,1637949017,r2sssx,1,False,1,"So I was reading on the internet that from 6 month and above cats should be fed twice a day. Is that okay? That seems like a long gap between feeding time.

I'm thinking about trying it. Cause right now his schedule is a mess. He eats basically every time he opens his eyes. For example, I give him dry food in the morning. He eats, grooms then will close his eyes but if he hears a noise and wakes up after like 5 minutes he will literally scream in my ear for food as if he's been hungry for days. Eventually I just give him food. (I Know it's bad.)
I'm also thinking about eliminating dry food cause apparently that's not very good for cats.
If I do feed only twice a day how much should I feed per feeding time? And how to introduce him to this new schedule.

I have 2 cats, both former strays. One is very well behaved and doesn't make any noise. The other hasn't stopped yowling at night in a month. I was told that this might be because she's not spayed, but I'm not sure since she was a stray so I have to check with the vet. 

It might also be because she's bored, but she plays a lot with the other cat, fighting and chasing each other. And I also try to play with her using some toys before sleeping, but toys can't keep her attention and she runs off to yowl after ~10 minutes. I have a fishing pole toy that she would play with depending on her mood. A ball that she doesn't touch at all. And a laser pointer that she also ignores.

It might be because she's an outdoors cat, but I live in an apartment so I can't really let her out. And I also have a nice window view for her to sit by. However this just allows her to yowl by the window at night. 

This also lead to a bad habit where I feed her at night trying to quiet her down, but she will continue yowling not long after. The only other thing I tried is petting her which does make her quiet but this too doesn't tire her out, and I think reinforces her behavior.

Our kitten was given to us by a local vets office, he is a very young stray kitten, only 5 weeks or so when we got him. We expected accidents but now it seems to be a pattern. He is not neutered yet and he can't be until he is older, according to the vet. 

First week, he didn't like the litter I bought and made some mistakes, peed on my partner's lap, pooped under the cabinet, and pissed the bed a few times (he loves to sleep with us and we love it too but we can't trust him not to pee the bed so now he stays in the other room at night and he hates that.

Timeline/Info:

I have two cats, both Female, spayed and 5 years old (littermates, we‚Äôve had them since they were kittens). Kiki is mostly attached to myself, whereas Kitters is attached to my mom. They got along fine until..

December 2020, my mom had to have back surgery. She had to move into the master bedroom because it has an attached bathroom. Big change, but Kitters didn‚Äôt seem to mind toooo much. \*Then\*, my sister came out to take care of my mom during recovery, but she‚Äôs allergic to cats so Kitters couldn‚Äôt be in my mom‚Äôs room anymore until she left (New Years 2021). Boom, even bigger change. It was at this point where I noticed small changes in Kitters behavior, she would growl when she had toys in her mouth and dunk them in the water bowl and wouldn‚Äôt let Kiki play with them. I noticed their ‚Äúplaying‚Äù starting to be less and less friendly. Kiki, however, didn‚Äôt change at all, still as happy as could be. 

March 2021, the cats had a huge fight in the middle of the night. Thankfully little blood was shed, but we knew they needed to be apart for a while. At this point I did a ton of research (Binged Jackson Galaxy videos, read articles and watched other videos on harmony in multicat households, I have pages and pages of notes) and set up ‚Äúbase camps‚Äù in each of our bedrooms, and a new routine. (For example one cat will stay in the bedroom during the day while the other gets to roam around the house. Then, at dinner time, they switch off and do the opposite until tomorrow night‚Äôs dinner) We also did the feeding at opposite sides of the door thing, setting up multiple litter boxes, etc. They also get to take turns playing outside with us in the backyard, which they love (supervised of course). We pretty much went through the whole checklist of what to do! We were ready to try reintroducing them until‚Ä¶

Summer 2021, Kitters stared peeing on my mom‚Äôs bed whenever she would leave for work. We noticed it was sparkly, and sure enough the poor baby had a UTI. We gave her medicine (super stressful for her, had to use Feliway in order for her to feel comfortable enough to let us give her drops) and switched her food, and she is now infection free! We also know there are no other underlying medical problems, as both cats have had their annual physicals. 

The Problem: 

You can probably tell that I‚Äôve put a lot of effort into this (hours of reading, watching, playing with both cats multiple times a day, making sure they scent swap, I‚Äôve even reintroduced them informally a few times and it‚Äôs gone pretty well.) The problem is, my mom isn‚Äôt, and won‚Äôt take anything I say seriously. Kitters still pees on the bed sometimes (I would say a few times a week) and my mom gets pissed at her and thinks she‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing it on purpose to make her mad.‚Äù Like, hello? How many times have I told you about cat behaviorism and psychology! She‚Äôs not doing it to make you mad, and getting mad at her for it is going to make her even more stressed out. It wasn‚Äôt until we went to the vet again and he pretty much said exactly what I‚Äôve been saying the whole time (Play with her everyday before you leave the house so she‚Äôll get her nervous energy out, make a calendar and track which days she has ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù and sleuth together what caused the anxiety) and she acts like she‚Äôs never heard it before lol. 

I just really want things to go back to normal. Kiki has no behavior problems whatsoever and I can tell she wants her sister back. Kitters really is a sweetheart, she‚Äôs just super sensitive and has some major separation anxiety with my mom, which stresses her out and causes behavior issues. I‚Äôm just worried my mom isn‚Äôt going to put the work in, even though she needs to because this is a two-person effort. I can‚Äôt do this by myself and if she doesn‚Äôt put in work, it‚Äôs never going to be resolved!

He‚Äôll go for the counters every time. I‚Äôve also been trying to avoid other alternatives for stimulation or attention whenever he does it while I‚Äôm trying to do dishes or cook, and he did a decent job with it today for a while, but then it was right back to consistent counter surfing and me needing to get him down. I know that reinforcement and training can definitely take a while sometimes, but I still just feel like what I‚Äôm doing/have been able to do isn‚Äôt working. My next step is to try sticky mats and a calming pheromone, in case it‚Äôs anxiety related. I‚Äôm not sure what would cause any anxiety on his behalf right now, as there have been no environment changes, and no other major changes in his routine. The only thing is that my bf is home more now since he‚Äôs been off work due to having a surgery, but he says that kitty is just asleep or chilling during the day, so I can‚Äôt imagine that having someone home during that time is a huge issue of stress for him, but it could still be a routine change.

Now, he‚Äôs been good about going to sleep, but is still waking me up by basically pummeling my body hours before I need to wake up. He‚Äôll also run around the room and mess with things, even if I have toys in there for him. Sometimes I can get him to calm back down, and other times I‚Äôll end up losing 30+ minutes of sleep before I give up and put him out. I saw some advice when I was searching this up of only letting him in when he‚Äôs calm, and putting him out when he‚Äôs not, and also making sure that he doesn‚Äôt get fed when he‚Äôs acting up like that. I know he‚Äôs young and active, so there‚Äôs only so much that can be done, it‚Äôs just very frustrating to lose sleep. I‚Äôd like to have my cake and eat it too if possible.

Ksizzle2_0,1637425344,qy8ywd,2,False,1,"Hi! I recently joined this sub because I really need your advice. My six month old Ragdoll kitten (‚ÄúMazikeen‚Äù) is having issues going potty in her litter box.

For some time now, my kitten has not been covering up her poop but she has been pooping in the litter box. We use ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Multi-cat‚Äù litter (the red bag). But ever since her spay two weeks ago, she has been standing on the very edge of her box to urinate. Then she tries to cover up her pee by scratching at her litter mat. It‚Äôs as if she is trying to lift up the trapped litter from under the mat to cover her urine. 

Last night though, Mazikeen actually pooped on the litter mat! And obviously without any luck, she tried to scratch up the trapped litter from under the litter mat to cover her feces. 

I took Mazikeen back to the vet to rule out any UTI‚Äôs or infections. The vet thought that she could be experiencing discomfort from her incision. He
prescribed ‚ÄúGabapentin.‚Äù However, it has been two days on this medicine with no improvement in her litter behaviours.

And to clarify: nothing about her litter box has changed. Which is why I mentioned that these new urinating and defecating behaviours began developing prior to her spay. 

It‚Äôs as if she is confusing the litter mat with a litter box. I messaged the breeder and she also agreed that this may be the issue. She suggested not using a mat at all. The breeder never used mats with them.

To test my theory, I removed the mat last night from under the litter box. When I checked it this morning, I saw she had urinated just fine in her box with no outside messes.

But I also moved the box from its old location into our main floor bathroom just in case there were any accidents that needed to be taken care of. 

Had anyone experienced this before? Any suggestions or recommendations are highly appreciated!!

My 15-year-old cat Tiger has been showing some aggression towards me on and off for about 2 years now. The typical scenario is I'll sit on the couch with my laptop in my lap. Tiger happily jumps up and lounges across my forearms and keyboard, purring and kneading her paws, being her normal lapcat self. I've got homework to do, so I keep typing with my hands under her. She stops purring, her eyes get round, she gets still and then bites me, locking her teeth just hard enough to break the skin. She usually sinks in the claws at this point too. I've tried a few different things:  


If I freeze, she slowly sinks her teeth in more and more until I have to give up because ouch!   


If I try to dodge her by moving my arm out of the way, it sends her into what I call ""attack mode,"" and she chases after the arm, scratching and biting harder than before. Her body language during that is puffed up, super round eyes, no purring.  


If I spray her with a water bottle, she runs away, then within ten seconds *jumps back up to attack me again.* This is the same ""attack mode"" as when I dodge too fast.  


I've tried scruffing her while she's locked in the bite on my arm, which causes a stalemate where she stays perfectly still while biting me until I slowly extricate my other arm. Then I put her on the ground. If I just let her go, she often comes back to attack again once or twice. This makes me think that *she* thinks she's dominant, so I've tried gently pushing her over onto her side and pinning her with one arm while scruffing her with the other for about 15 seconds. That seems to defuse the situation, because she usually stalks away after that.  


In every case, she's back to trying to snuggle within about 15 minutes of the attack.   


Other things that set her off include flipping the pages in my book while she's in my lap, standing up while she's in my lap, and even sometimes doing nothing at all. Petting her doesn't set her off. 95% of the time, these attacks are directed at me--she's attacked my boyfriend once or twice and our roommate never, even though she sits in their laps a lot.  


About four months ago, she had her teeth cleaned and some rotten ones pulled out, after which she's become much more active and playful. But the biting has been pretty constant throughout the last two years. When she wants to sit with me, she cannot be stopped--even as I type this, she's tried five or six times to lounge across my hands. The attacks happen a few times a week.  


Most of the advice I can find about biting seems to be directed towards kittens or very young cats, not geriatric ones like Tiger. Is she just a curmudgeon? I appreciate any and all advice you can offer!",CatTraining,"15-year-old cat bites me if I move after she sits in my lap, help!"

Unfortunately, her cat didn't take the new intruder too well and my mom didn't have the space or patience to try to get the two of them to be nice to each other, so my husband and I took her in again and are trying to integrate her into our household, which is 2 cats (13 and 10 years old) and an almost 3 year old 50 lb dog.

The mom cat (named her Elsa after the tropical storm that came through when we got her) does well-ish with the 13 year old cat and our dog. We thought the 10 year old (Nala) and Elsa would become friends, but Nala is not doing well. 

We did a slow introduction. The three cats all eat together with no gate between them in the same room and no one has a problem with it. Elsa has literally stuck her head in Nala‚Äôs food bowl while Nala was eating and no one cared. We of course moved Elsa away to not encourage that behavior. I think they like food more than they hate each other. Haha. They play through a gate well ish. They rarely hiss at each other just in terms of being near each other or seeing each other. Some ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre too close to me. Back off!‚Äô swats happen though still. 

The main issue is Nala keeps chasing after Elsa to the point where sometimes Elsa sees her and she runs and hides under the couch. Nala sees her, her tail gets swishy, and she watches her from across the room and then sometimes starts the chase. If it was just once a day, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, but we‚Äôre talking multiple times a day. And it does not seem like play for them. It MIGHT be play for Nala, but Elsa is definitely not okay with the chasing. She panic runs under the couch for a defensive position and hissing and slaps happen. Sometimes Nala won‚Äôt back off and we have to make her stop. We are wondering if maybe Elsa just does not handle being chased well because of being a stray. She won‚Äôt stand her ground. She just runs. I have also noticed that Nala will walk to a spot that Elsa was at and sniff everything. Not sure why. We‚Äôve done scent swapping with them many times. She should be used to her smell.

I don‚Äôt know what steps I need to do to help them get along or at least make Nala stop chasing her so much. We‚Äôve tried playing with Nala first to tire her out, but she doesn‚Äôt seem interested in chasing toys enough to help. Distracting Nala seems to help. For a few weeks we tried playing with Elsa and bringing Nala into the room while playing too and Nala would be too distracted to go after Elsa. But it doesn‚Äôt help completely.

I feel very strongly this is not a medical issue but learned behavior I'm desperate to correct. 4 months ago, our cat had constipation (we were trying new foods our vet suggested which seems to have caused it) and he started to use the bathroom on our jute rug (both numbers but mostly pee) under our dining room table. We took him to the vet several times, they checked him out for a lot and tried a variety of things, and the problem seemed to be the constipation / going outside the litter box to show something was wrong. Once we switched him back to his old food, he has seemed perfectly fine ever since. Regular poops and eating normally. Way too early on, I replaced the original jute rug with the next jute rug. Like a week after discovering the accidents. He went on that rug too. After that, we had no rug down for a month and no problems, so we tried putting down a soft ""decoy"" rug under the dining room table for the last two months, and had zero issues (he's also never peed on any other rugs in the house). He never went on the decoy rug and has beee completely normal for months. So I thought we were finally in the clear and got a jute rug again. It's only been three days and he's already peed on it. In his defense, a jute rug is probably the closest texture and look to a litter box, but I thought we had gotten past this issue. I'd love to not shell out more money for a new rug, and stop this behavior, but not sure how, since it seems like at this point he thinks the jute rugs are just an extra bathroom for him an he somehow recognizes that.",CatTraining,How to Stop Cat from Peeing on Jute Rug

I've got 3 cats. 2 males and a female. All fixed. The two males have been together for a couple years now, and they were getting along amazingly. Now, recently, they've been fighting. They've always been each other's play buddies, but now it seems like my boy Felix won't let my other boy Toshi take a break from playing. They'll start playing like normal, but then Felix starts to get rougher and rougher until Toshi growls and runs away. Normally, Felix would have just walked away and respected Toshi. But now all of a sudden he gives chase. He completely backs Toshi into a corner and I have to break them up before Toshi goes wholesale whoppass on Felix. 

Things I've tried:
- Giving them another perch so they can avoid each other.
- Giving Felix a collar with a bell.
- New toys
- Redirecting attention with toys
- More playtime
- Separate food bowls (they already had this)
- New food hierarchy (Felix, the oldest, is now on top of the cat tree. Toshi is in a crate because he likes to steal the other two's food.)
- Another water bowl (there's two now)
- Squirt bottle for punishment
- Catnip in separate areas

I'm at my wits end with them... I'm too afraid to leave them alone now... Any ideas? Is this just their relationship now? They get along like lovers in everything but this, so it happens practically without warning. I really just want them to get along again.

He's very high energy and more motivated by play than food. 

I took in an abandoned kitten that had been wandering around a friend's home last tuesday, and started properly introducing my cats on Friday (after a vet visit, flea treatment, and having to start over with setting up a homebase because the kitten vomited all over his first homebase thanks to the dewormer). I've been following Jackson Galaxy's advice, swapping out toys and trying to get my older cat to eat treats in front of the kitten's door. My older cat won't eat his regular meals in front of the door yet - only hand fed treats. He's mostly curious about the kitten's room, but he also hissed at the door last night. This morning I was able to get him to eat some treats right in front of the kitten's door, when previously I was only able to do this if I sat in between him and the door so his attention was on me. 

Today, I put kitten in my older cat's homebase (my room) and was playing with him when my older cat came up to the door and started sniffing around curiously. I tried putting my fingers under the door to distract him from getting territorial and he started batting at my fingers gently (he's very good about not using his claws or biting when playing with hands). Since he was being playful and not aggressive, I decided to crack the door slightly and use a string on a stick. My cat loooves playing with string, especially if the string is sort of ""hidden"" and he has to find it. 

Older cat and kitten sort of took turns batting at the string for like a minute or two, with one cat sniffing the other curiously while the other played. I think eventually this became too much for my older cat because he hissed and then backed away from the door. The kitten didn't seem shaken up at all so I gave him some reassuring pets and then went to check on the older cat. He also seemed totally fine and not ""stuck"" with his eyes locked on the door like he has a couple times since I've brought the kitten home.

FirstTimeCatMama,1636234944,qo9zrt,5,False,1,"Hi everyone! I know the title of this post is a little odd so let me explain!  


Our kitten (m, 5mo) is a playful, excitable young BSH. We're a single cat household and have been having a really hard time of it recently. His mood switches so frequently that it's hard to keep up. One minute we're playing with us, then the next (mid-play), he pounce on us and bite. He breaks skin at least 1/2 a week and it's got to the point where we're talking about adoption.

We have tried everything! Every technique out there and won't be getting another kitten as, quite frankly, one is draining enough! I see so many people on Socials showing their kitten resting on them and being loving but he is opposite. He isn't fond of pets, even just on the head, and sometimes even when I go to present my hand (for him to smell), he'll try to attack.  


I have anxiety and so, of course, I think that's all my fault and his behaviour issues are my fault even though I'm really trying to be patient with him. It's so difficult to feel affection for him, when all he does is attack. A lot of the times we do nothing to provoke him and he still attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

(We have tried various techniques: Jackson Galaxy, Spray Bottles, ignoring, distracting, a high 'OW!', a stern 'No!'. We play with him as much as we can and he has plenty of toys for when we're at work.)",CatTraining,Kitten bites in the middle of play
Stormatary,1636221553,qo5m63,2,False,1,"Oliver the Cat lives with me, and he is always curious whenever I am cooking a meal. 

He wants to sniff the vegetables and meat that I am preparing and attempts to drink from sauces that are prepared in a bowl. I don't really mind him walk on the counter, but when I am cooking, this behavior is a big no-no. The stove is right next to counter, whenever I am pan frying steak, the hot oil can jump everywhere. Also, I am using sharp knives and cooking machines, Oliver the Cat can potentially hurt himself if he is not careful. 

I have been struggling to teach him not to jump on the counter while I am cooking. I tried to pick him up and put him onto the couch which is a safer distance that he can watch me cook, or simply pushed him off the counter. 

But these methods do not seem to work on him. 

After talking to my friends, they suggested me a different way to train Oliver not to do something. 

The idea is DRI.  Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior. Positive in reducing the presence of inappropriate behavior. Reinforce (Reward) behavior that will prevent the display of the undesirable behavior.  

In common terms, distract the kitten to do target behavior, so he doesn't have time to do bad behaviors. 

In my case,  I don‚Äôt want Oliver to jump onto the kitchen counter while I am cooking. Before I start cooking, I will feed him to distract him from jumping onto the counter. Or I can put him onto where I usually pet him. Play with him a little bit, then put on his favorite movie to distract him. For me, I will have good background noise to enjoy while cooking.

gettingsentimental,1636217746,qo4chz,2,False,1,"Hi all,

A month ago we adopted a young male cat (\~1yr) from a shelter. His name is Bolin. He had been rescued from Tennessee after the storms. It is clear that he had a loving home and was well taken care of in his kittenhood (loves people, is gentle with claws, etc). Over the last month or so we've learned a lot about him, such as his sensitivity to being touched (he absolutely allows it, but it hypes him up immensely and then he does dumb things). 

Anyway, Bolin is a total love and likes to give kisses and lick things, as well as play fetch. He has been  practically attached to our hips. 

We also have a 1.5yr female who also loves her humans. Her name is Tatini. We raised her from kittenhood (around 10 weeks old) and she's a typical female in that she loves pets on her terms and will hang out with us on her terms as well, and this is more often than not. She is spooked easily, but is also brave and gets comfortable again quickly. 

The introduction has been okay: exhausting keeping them apart and figuring it out, but they're able to be in the same room together, sleeping near each other, and can now play back and forth with a human and one toy. They always eat together and can be right next to each other through the meal. We only recently started letting him stay out at night time (three days so far) instead of being in his room. 

Here are the issues: 

1. Despite how much we play with him and try to distract him, all of a sudden a switch will go off in Bolin (spontaneous, no common threads) and he will obsessively want to chase Tatini. We try to distract him with play for even 15mins straight and he'll get tired, but then something will click again and he will chase her out of nowhere (going from a laying down, paws tucked position to full chase)
2. It is VERY rare that he'll be in a room alone. He constantly seeks us or her out. Tatini doesn't like company all the time, which makes it contentious. Recently he pretty much only wants to be with her, and she just doesn't want that all the time. So when she's okay with it, everything is fine. But when she starts growling and telling him to f\*ck off, he only listens 1/3rd of the time or so. 
3. When we stand up, even if he appears to be sleeping, he will automatically stand up to follow us. 

Current strategies:

1. We are rewarding him with treats when he leaves her alone after she growls
2. We're reward Tatini with treats when she tolerates him and shows interest, such as noses touching and when he's intruding her personal space bubble. She especially LOVES treats so this has been our primary way of warming her up to him.
3. When his tail gets super swishy we try to distract him. Often this is fruitless, because he becomes hyper fixated on her. I sometimes put a hand on him to and he lies down, and I try to help him to slow down and relax. This \*sometimes\* works. The thing that works best is to put him in timeout (we have a screen door we set up in an entryway, ensuring he has sufficient space to move and settle). We let him out after about 10‚Äì20 minutes and he's generally calmed down. 

Questions:

1. I've been saying how I think that he may have been traumatized from losing his family during the storms and that's why he's so obsessive about being with us. Is this a possibility? I know cats can be traumatized in other ways, so I'm wondering if this might be part of it.
2. His inability to stay asleep when we leave the room is concerning. Is this the kind of anxiety that would benefit from medication? (We will be talking to our vet soon, after we get our thoughts fully gathered.)
3. With this being said, I'm worried that when we go visit my family for 10 days it's going to seriously stress him out. This will be a month and a week from now. Thoughts?
4. Any other advice on how to support him? 
5. What about our little girl? She's definitely not sleeping as well as she used to and it's hard to give her as much affection as we did before and complete our routines since he \*\*always\*\* comes over when we're petting her. We used to have a routine in the mornings and evenings where she would stand on my chest while I was laying down in bed and have me pet her cute little face for like, 15 minutes straight. This is gone now :( I think she's just not comfortable being in the same place as him all the time, so she isn't sleeping with us when he's out, which I can't imagine feels great for her.

ZennyMindState,1636169032,qnrpno,2,False,1,"Hey there, I just wanted to share my experience and hope someone may have some tricks or suggestions. 

I‚Äôll try and make a long story short. I adopted my KitKat from the Humane Society in August. She is two years old and a white and black female. This is my first cat and I‚Äôve wanted my own forever. I choose to adopt from the humane society so they would already have  shots and be fixed. They had no kittens after waiting months to find the right one. So finally while adopting this one I wasn‚Äôt able to interact with the cats and see their personality being Covid restrictions they would only let you look in same cage as 7 other cats but not touch or play with them. 

Now that I see her temperament I am hoping I can find ways to help make my cat want my affection and want to spend time with me. 

I‚Äôll try to explain more. She is not a bad kitty or anything. She is pretty quiet most times and has never meowed though she does do loud a cooing noise very often like she wants something. The problem is she only wants/tolerates attention, to play, or doing anything basically for a few minutes at most then she‚Äôs done. After that she just sits outside my doorway making her noise constantly. I‚Äôve tried so many different things to make her happy, I‚Äôve tried giving her lots of space and I‚Äôve tried giving her something different to do every time she asks. I know cats only want to do things on their terms but it‚Äôs almost like my cat has ADHD. Whatever she is doing she will only stay interested for a short amount of time. 

Otherwise she is a pretty calm cat it could be much worse I am happy for what I have. I just want to know if cats can change and if she will ever want my affection. I guess I‚Äôve always wanted like a lap cat like a therapy cat but I don‚Äôt think that will happen with this one. I feel like she‚Äôs already developed her personality so I don‚Äôt think a big change like that could happen. But even if she doesn‚Äôt come around I‚Äôll still love the little bugger.

jmrdpt19,1636153737,qnn3rp,6,False,1,"Title explains my issue. We have an approximately 1 year old cat and a large dog (who after a LOT of work tolerate each other). The cat always has made a mess of his water which was awful when he was being introduced and living mostly in a carpeted closet, but now that he can roam the house, he uses the dog's water on the kitchen (8 cup stainless steel bowl). 

Here is my problem.  At least 3 times a day, the cat will decide it is his job to move the water bowl into the middle of the room, and try to tip it over. This leaves a huge mess and I'm sick of wet towels everywhere. 

My dog is trained through R+ methods and has her CGC, a trick tile, and some legs toward scent work titles, so I understand dog behavior pretty well, however, I have a hard time with the cat who will bite my hand or swipe at me with his claws if I have any treats and they're not in front of him fast enough (plus he's overweight so we're trying to limit treats). So I'm pretty frustrated with him. 

My current method (which I know is not ideal) is when I hear him splashing the water, I go find him, pick him up and set his feet in the water puddle he made and then put him away in the cat room without attention, (just putting him away didn't work either)

I am getting a big ceramic bowl with my dog's next food shipment to hopefully make it harder to tip the bowl

throwaway2727CJ,1635849740,ql1fsl,7,False,1,"Hello, 
Late August we adopted a kitten (4 months 1/2). We were told she was a scared kitten, although social, but on the first night she was already sleeping on my lap and since then, she has followed me everywhere (even to the bathroom) when I am at home. I work 5 days a week so during the day, she usually sleeps in my clothes. She is now almost 7 months and has been spayed a month ago. My husband started working 2 weeks and a half ago and was previously at home with her, but she would still sleep in my clothes during the day and, sometimes only, sit near him. 
I have been the one feeding her 95% of the time, cleaning the litter box, etc. I play with her in the morning and several times at night, and my husband plays with her too. 
However, I am quite an early sleeper, and my sleep is very easily disturbed, and my husband is not, so I often close the door to our room at night. During that time, my husband plays video games and is quite absorbed by the game, although he does play with her at times. He has headphones on to speak with the friends he plays with. That‚Äôs when our kitten starts running everywhere, but also on some occasions, scratches him. She makes books fall to the ground, jumps on the bin, and does everything possible to drive him mad, in a way, it seems she is testing him. On Sunday night, he left her alone for 5mn in a closed room with her litter box so she would calm down and when he opened the door, she was indeed calmer. I was unaware of how serious it was, but yesterday, we found out that, probably during the time my husband had locked her in the room, she had peed on his stuff (passport and important documents, all his with his scent on it) although the litter box was nearby. 
We cleaned the area and last night, I left the door to the room open. She slept at my feet all night long and seemed quite happy. 
I feel she may have separation anxiety as she is very clingy with me, but it mostly happens at night as she does not seem to mind being alone at home during the day. The anxiety is here when she knows I‚Äôm in a room she cannot access.
I want to see what solutions we can have to minimise this anxiety. Unfortunately we live in an apartment and do not have space for a second cat. I will keep my door open at night even if it may wake me up at times, and I also want my husband to be the one feeding her at least half the time. Our kitten has many toys, so I will try to increase play time to at least 10mn 4 times a day. She also has a cat tree, and 4 huge French windows - she loves to sit and watch the mountains and birds by the window. She also eats and drinks water well and does not seem to be food focused. I have ordered some pheromones diffuser to lessen her anxiety too. 
Is there something else I could do to lessen her anxiety and improve her quality of life? Yesterday when we found out she had peed on my husband‚Äôs stuff, I felt extremely guilty and became upset as she seemed to be a very happy kitten until now. I also felt guilty towards my husband, but he knows she is just a kitten and also wants to make sure she is happy with us.

Hi everyone!

I'm a first-time kitten mama and feel completely out of my depth.My male kitten (19 weeks) is a playful, excitable and energetic Cat. We've had him from 8 weeks and while at the beginning, he didn't bite much, as he got older, it got worse and they started to hurt.

He is now breaking skin every few days and is really holding on and at times, has Rabbit kicked and even goes for our Faces. I am beginning to lose affection for him and find that the more he bites, the less patience I have. Generally, when he does bite and grab on, we put him in the our room (a big kitchen) for a time-out and to allow him to calm down but I don't want that kind of relationship with him.

He'll literally be lying on us one minute, with his eyes shut, purring and the next he's chomping down on our arms and holding on for dear life! Every time that I have to remove him from me, my anxiety kicks in and I feel like I'm a rubbish Cat Mama, and that the reason he's acting out is because I'm not giving him enough attention. I work from home and so he has someone with him in the mornings until 12 noon and then back again around 5/6PM. During then, he usually sleeps.

We have spoken about rehoming, as it's gotten so bad. He has plenty of toys and we don't think getting another cat, just for the sake of him, is a good idea. If we are getting one, we went it to be for us, not him. He gets regular check-ups at the Vets so we're at a loss.

So i thought that maybe he does this because he s hungry, so the first times he woke me up at that hour i fed him. Obviously he noticed that and at this point he purposely wakes me up every day at 7:30 am just for me to feed him. Cuz he   s used to it. The problem is after i feed him he starts to be very loud, jumps everywhere, spills the trash bin, breaks everything. So basically his tradition is waking me up at 7:30 am, i feed him, then he s incredibly noisy for around 40 mins, which i don t sleep at all.

Now, my cat had problem on his tail for which the vet recommended me a spray, he was ok with it at first but at the end of the treatment he started to get scared every time i had to spray him in the area. Even if the treatment is done, i still have the spray. So when he was waking me up and meowing constantly in my room i used to just pick up the spray and he would instantly leave my room. Or spray a little towards him (not on him) to scare him for him to leave my room and let me sleep. 

Now i bought an empty spray which i wanna fill with water and use that instead. But i m scared. I don t want my cat to hate me, i don t want to scare him either. But i just want to sleep. I feel he s already more distant with me since i started to shout at him and use the vet spray. I dont  want to do anything bad, i just want to sleep. It s been weeks if not months that i didn t get a full night of undisturbed sleep. He wakes me up at 7 am and keeps me up 1 hr, time in which he meows constantly and ruins the house, i have to get up from bed 1000 times just to stop him from breaking or chewing on random things or spilling the trash bin. He only comes in my room and meows jn my room and ruins everything in my room. It s like he wants to just wake ME up. He never does this in my mom s room. On the other hand he used to also only cuddle me and sleep with me. He never cuddles my mom to sleep if i m home. Only if i m not.

I don t know what to do. If spraying your cat with water is bad, how else to make him leave my room and let me sleep, or how else to make him stop from being crazy?

The introduction process initiated itself earlier than we would have liked, but it doesn't look like there will be any problems. The cats are from different litters, but all share the same parents. They are Bengals, which makes them ostensibly easier to train.

All get fancy wet food and are free-fed dry food because they are growing so quickly. Spike and Faye could share wet food perfectly (and adorably), and the new kittens are also sharing well. Right now Spike is eating in the kitchen and the kittens are eating in their introductory room, my library, and I think this will work fine indefinitely. We feed them at the same time so there are no interactions during feeding. 

But I don't want a permanent feeding station in the library, and I have no idea whether Max and Furiosa will be willing or able to share when they are adults. We are also going to stop free-feeding dry food once they are fully grown. 

Will three dispersed feeding stations be necessary, or could they each have their own bowls in the kitchen? They usually don't leave any wet food behind (and they would learn not to do this if other cats had access), but one might invade a slower eater's bowl during mealtime. 

It would be realistic (and a pain in the ass) to train each to stick to its own wet food bowl in the kitchen, and I have some ideas about methods, but I wonder what any of you might have done in this area? 

And what do you do when it comes to dry food? I will eventually want each of them to eat a specific amount per day, but it's not there for them to eat all at once and if it would be a pain in the ass to train them to use their own bowls for wet food, it would be a nightmare training them not to graze on each others' dry food allotments...

Any ideas?

--------

For the wet food, I think I will try this:

Once the kittens are released, I think I will start by giving them three unique wet food bowls in different corners of the kitchen and gradually move them closer to each other, monitoring and removing cats who encroach on others' food after they are finished with their own. I have had great luck with the ""remove the cat from the object"" technique. 

But what about the dry food? It is good and natural for cats to eat a little when they want to and I don't want to take this away.

Results are mixed so far. It has been about a week and 2 days. We were told if the older cat peed on anything that the kitten has been on then it‚Äôs a non starter and to give the kitten back.

-Keeping them separated all day and night

-Having them roam free and just squirting my male cat with a water gun every time he stalks my bf's cat/attacks her. (this led to his cat being super scared and she went to the bathroom outside of her litter box a few times, so we stopped this option and moved them back to being separated.)

**This is going to be long - sorry! But I figure the more context the better.** 

Early this year my partner and I moved in together with my 6 year old cat, Marnie. Up until then she had been living with 2 dogs, an outdoor cat who she saw intermittently, and several people, so she never spent longer than a couple of hours alone and loved attention. Once we moved and we were both going to work every day, we noticed that her behaviour was totally changed. She seemed restless, clingy and vocal. We asked some questions and were generally met with ""she's lonely"", so of course we adopted a kitten, Moby. We thought that because she was so social with the dogs and never hissed at or seemed scared of the other cat, she would adjust fine after a while of careful introductions (and yes, we used the Jackson Galaxy method).

After the first few weeks, they got as far as playing together for about 5 mins before Marnie decided she was not happy with this new arrangement.

It has now been about 5 months and she still absolutely hates him. We have had to keep them seperated for the most part. We tried and re-tried the JG method several times (seperating them completely for about a week in between) but Marnie was just not cooperating with her new eating schedule and wouldn't eat if she could hear Moby eating on the other side of the door. She doesn't play with toys (never has - she's weird) so we couldn't make any progress the eat-play-love thing. We went so far as to design and build a rental-friendly screen door that sat in the doorway between Moby's designated safe room and the rest of the unit, and built them a cat tree (mansion). Nothing seems to have helped.

Strangely, there are very occasional moments where it seems like it's getting better - Marnie will be sleeping on the couch and Moby will pitch up next to her with only a couple of soft growls in response. It usually ends in a scuffle after a while though.

The big problem as I see it is that Moby is a bully! He isn't scared of her - instead he runs at her every time he lays eyes on her, and usually backs down once he's been hissed and growled and swatted at, but then gears up and does it again seconds later. He doesn't just bully her either. For unknown reasons, he attacks me every day throughout the day (I work from home) fully unprovoked, and sometimes will even dodge toys during play sessions to get at my hands instead. I have never used physical punishment or intentionally used my hands to play with him (even as a tiny kitten), but still somewhere along the way he decided I was his favourite chew toy. 

Marnie has now started to become aggressive and swatty with me, too. She used to love being picked up and carted around, but nowadays she will cry out and swat at my head if I do. She always wants to go outside and freaks out when we try to bring her back in (she's an indoor cat but we take her for walks on a lead). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Extras if it helps:**

\-We live in a small unit, but Marnie has her own secret place up high to retreat to. We're moving into a bigger place in January, possibly with other people (will that relieve the tension?)

\-Moby is allowed to run around and roam when Marnie is up in her high place (which is usually for most of the day - she comes down at night).

\-Here's what I can see of their body language in all situations:

**Marnie when Moby is present:** Little soft growls if he's in the room but not looking at her. Howling, growling, hissing, spitting if he's near - if he approaches she tenses up and screams. Will swat and carry on if he gets close. Tail not puffy and back not arched though. (She is always at the top of the cat tree in these situations).

**Moby at all times:** Locks eyes on Marnie as soon as we let him out and charges. Usually wide eyes, ears forward (until he gets hissed at, then ears back). No hissing ever. Can't be on ground level with her for even a second or he will jump her and she freaks out.

**Moby when he's attacking me:** Ears back, wide eyes, forehead crinkles. Will not stop until I'm dead. Considering letting him have the house and moving out.

Sorry for the mammoth read, but I'm honestly at a loss. I can't keep Moby couped up any longer - he's just getting too big and restless and it's unfair. But I can't trust them together for any length of time either. Moby is my partner's pick and he loves him, so rehoming him is not an option (plus I would hate for him to bite someone less patient and wind up hurt or put down).

It‚Äôs currently 5:40 am and it‚Äôs one of those rare nights where my cat gets randomly aggressive and wants to get out. (Sorry if this is bad formatted, I‚Äòm currently on my phone)

I have two cats, both are about 8 years old and they live together since 5 years or so but have known each other since they were kittens. One is a small common cat (female), the other a Maine Coon (male) - both sterilized.
They always had a ‚Äúlove-hate‚Äù relationship but it seemed to calm down in the last years.
They can both go outside whenever they want and they like to do that at around 5-6 am every morning.

Now, coming to the problem.
My Maine Coon gets randomly aggressive maybe 1-2 times a month. This is going on for maybe 4 months now. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs being haunted or something. He hisses, growls and even lashes out if you get too close to him but still sits in front of the door and wants to get out, angrily wagging his tail, btw.
Sometimes when he has his fit of anger and walks towards the door, he suddenly jumps and cries out as if someone stepped on him or something, even tho I‚Äôm far away. He turns around, hisses, growls and walks on.
He has had a few injuries in his life. At around 1 year old, he had hip dysplasia on one side and his joint got necrotic so they had to remove it.
A few years ago he collided with a car, lost a tooth or two and slightly tore his meniscus on the other leg but he was fine. I thought that maybe his leg hurts but when I try let him out, he runs down the stairs to the front door like nothing‚Äòs wrong and then he hisses and growls at me again, when I get down the stairs.
He sometimes meows like nothings wrong in between hissing and growling.
The problem is that his paws are huge and can really hurt you, so I try to keep my distance when opening doors.

I'm a single girl who got an 8 week old tabby kitty back in September. I never rly wanted more than 1 however he was incredibly needy, to the point I lost 4 pounds over a week because I wasn't eating;  I didn't have time to make myself food as he demanded I play with him or give him attention every second otherwise he'd start freaking out &amp; crying nonstop. It was too much, so I ended up going back &amp; getting one of his sisters later. Well now my boy is super chill, but now his sister has become the problem. They're about 3 months now, &amp; for a while they were ok sleeping in the living room &amp; not bothering me much til 6 or 7 am. I could live with that, however as time has progressed the new girl has started waking me up earlier &amp; earlier to the point she now wakes me up at 3 or 4 am nightly. And her cries are not easy to ignore, they are those real long yowls as if she's in legitimate pain (we've been to the vet, I know she's not). I would have no problem ignoring this except for the fact that I live in a low-rise wood-frame apartment on the 2nd floor. I'm mostly concerned about my neighbor living below me. I don't know them, however I have no doubt they can very likely hear these 3 or 4 am long &amp; drawn out yowls &amp; probably being woken up just like me. When I try to ignore her, she just keeps going for the next 15 minutes or so, which is way too long for me to expect people to put up with that in the middle of the night. I really try to be a considerate neighbor, &amp; we also get fined in the building if we get too many complaints.

I've tried squirting her when she does this with water then removing her from the room but she does not seem to care, even when she's soaked she just comes back to the door &amp; begins her howling a few seconds later (even if I come back &amp; squirt/remove her again). Her &amp; her brother have each other, so it's not like they're alone. They have a good rel. And I play with them every night before bed. Plus they have toys out every night.

I have a Feliway classic diffuser which does not seem to make any difference. Their bowls always have enough food when I wake up so I know it's not that, she genuinely just seems very needy. I would have no problem keeping them in my room with the door open except that I have a $1500 bedframe I bought last year that's made of a kind of a burlap material &amp; the headboard is super tall, so they LOVE to climb it, it's basically one giant scratching post to them. I keep my bedroom off limits to them even in the daytime because of this because even when they have been in there the few times, they immediately start jumping up, clawing &amp; climbing the headboard or footboard, to the point there's now already a giant rip in it even though they've only been in there a handful of times. I'm not doing well financially at the moment, so I really wouldn't even be able to afford a decent replacement bed right now. I'm not really sure what to do, when they wake me up at night I feel compelled to go out there and stay with them. I know that's all they want, because it stops the meowing. I'll curl up and start trying to sleep on the couch and they'll either sleep with me or pounce on me/wrestle between my legs with each other before eventually going to sleep near me or in their own bed on the floor. Does anyone have any suggestions about what I should do? I've genuinely started feeling sleep deprived &amp; super anxious at night.

We're stuck on what to do with our 6-month kitten. She has developed an interest towards jumping on our dining table, especially when no one is watching her.

We put boards with double sided sticky tape on the whole area, but doesn't seem like it acts as a deterrent. We've been doing this for at least two months. Aluminum foil is fun for her.

Whenever she gets caught before being able to get down on her own, we'll take her and calmly move her to a cat-friendly zone. Sometimes we might shout a firm NO, GET DOWN if the little rascal has done it several times the same day.

She responds okay towards clicker training, knows how to give her paw or high five. Knows the ""Down"" and ""up"" commands.

grammatizator,1634444055,q9riwu,0,False,1,"Hi! 

I adopted 2 8-week old littermates from my friend's mum. Ideally, yes they should have been with their mama a bit longer but she was rejecting them and they were getting to be a bit much for my friend's mum to handle. 

Anyway, I got a boy and a girl - we split the 4 littermates according to how playful they were. The girl, we're calling raji which is just a sweet little girl's name in India, is a real character and the boy, who we're calling Toshi after toshiro mifune because he has a hilarious black mark that looks like a samurai topknot, is a bit shy and needs his sister to show him the ropes. They came home last Friday on 8th October, I took them to the vet a few days later who sexed them, weighed them, checked their temperature and general body stuff etc. He says they seem on track for age and healthy and their poops and eating seem alright (yes I'm the type of person who brings my vet kitty poops for analysis). They got their first shots and they're due next week (22nd ish) for routine, proactive deworming and to see if we can set a date to fix them.

This is my first time with such little babies, all my cat experience has been with atleast 2+ year olds who have their own thing going. I have to teach them to use the litter box and a friend advised containing them in a room with the box and stuff until they get the hang of it. I used pine wood pellets in a shallow box in their ""room"" (the second bedroom in my flat which I use as a home office, there is only a desk and chair and I took out the bookshelves. The one cupboard is completely theirs with scratch pads taped on the shelves, soft bedding to sleep on etc. 

Toshi got the hang of litter immediately and we hoped raji would learn from him. She did a couple of pees on the bedding which I replaced so she wouldn't feel like going again. They were crying at night and I totally caved the first night and let them out and they came and slept with me and I moved the litter box to my room so they won't have to figure out going back to the second room. Toshi used the moved litter box no problem but raji might have gotten confused and went back to the original location in their room and went on the floor where the box was. 

I let them explore the living room and raji peed on the floor in the corner and I put a litter box there which seemed to do the trick. Raji has also peed on the same spot on my bed three times. I went back to the vet and told him. His advice - 

1. They are incredibly young and they WILL have accidents until at least 5-6 months so be patient.
2. Use non-ammonia cleaner on any place they peed where I don't want them to. He said to purchase enzymatic cleaner and make sure I get the spots on hard to clean stuff like my mattress and couch upholstery etc.
3. None of this wood pine litter for such young babies because they only naturally understand sand. He said to buy clay litter and that this makes sense to them and they can dig and scoop. 
4. Reset the confinement period and not to cave to their haunting meowing.

I got a larger corner box so they have more room to turn and kick and stuff, replaced the litter to clay completely and re started the confinement. My friend says one week at a minimum. I want them to enjoy the rest of the house and the large windows I have and be happy, what can I do to make this transition smoother/faster? 

Thanks to my older cats who have sadly passed on I'm a Jackson Galaxy devotee and have the routine setting in place. I'm trying to get these champs on the routine but will it stick or make sense for such teeny guys. I also come hang out with them for an hour or two in the morning when I wake up around 7 am for breakfast and for ""playtime"" at 4pm. Just before dinner I do 15 mins of catching and killing before they get dinner and I wind em down and put away the toys. 

They have scratchy things and seem to love to play with each other anyway. So I'm glad they aren't lonely or unhappy but is the pissing on random places a stress thing :( how do I make the babies less stressed?",CatTraining,Advice on housebreaking and routine setting 9-week old kittens
zoanthropic,1634426276,q9mwk5,6,False,1,"It genuinely breaks my heart to write this, but my cat (5 years old) has just turned on me in a weird way. He's usually an extremely affectionate cat, wanting to rub up against people and always looking for attention. Now, we also have a younger feral (about 2 at this stage, I think) who never really trusted me - probably because I'm the one that trapped her and brought her home with us. She adores my other half, so I don't feel so bad about that.

Now, I was out in the room where there litter trays are, petting both cats (the older fella all over me, the small girl being reluctant). I noticed she was being particularly cagey, so I backed away, but suddenly she hissed very loudly and bolted passed both myself and the other cat - this has happened before, I just leave her to her own hidey holes in these scenarios.

Now - the real devastation began. I went back to the older fella and he started hissing violently at me - I have extensive experience with cats and dogs, but this was really off. I walked out of the room thinking he had taken some of the wee girl's fear, but he followed me and started yowling in the most unholy way.

Fast forward 1.5 hours (right now) and he's LOOKING for me to pet him, but his eyes are still dilated and with once of the pets, he was rubbing his head, then suddenly turned, hissed and ran. It makes me extremely sad because this cat really is my best buddy and I don't have a clue what to do.

What's worse - my other half is at her parents tonight - because we're getting married tomorrow morning. This is somehow giving me a massive and I really mean massive dampener. I feel like my wee pal hates me, but that he doesn't want to. I don't want this to affect my mood for my wedding tomorrow either, but I don't know how it couldn't. I don't even want to tell her the details of what's going on, because I think she'd be distraught too.

But more than anything - I need to know how I can have my wee buddy be just that again - if only it was as simple as saying 'I didn't mean to scare you!'. It's midnight, I was mid-speech memorising, and I'm slightly broken by this, if you can pardon the dramatics. Any help, advice, experience or whatever would be much appreciated.

I am fostering a 4 year old Persian cat. She has been in another foster home the past 2 years, before that she was abandoned and found in a feral cat colony. She has never had these issues per the previous foster. I want to adopt her but I am worried this will never resolve.

I have had her now for close to 5 weeks. She plays, she purrs, eats well, etc. getting more comfortable overall.

I have watched her pee in the box, jump out, and poop on the floor right next to it. I have watched her poop on the floor and then jump into the litter box to pee. We solved any health issues and the vet says its behavioral. She was having diarrhea, I have mostly fixed it the past 3 days by giving her pumpkin puree, so her poops are looking pretty good now.

No other cats in the house and it's very quiet here so shouldn't be any stressors outside of her being in a new home.

I have tried:
- 2 large, open litter boxes (within my small bathroom but not side by side). She didn't care so I'm back to one for now. Put one in the living room for a couple days she didn't even look at it.
- Cat attractant litter + litter attractant. she pooped in the box once and never again. I swapped on of the litter boxes with it she wont even pee in it, so she must not like the feeling.
- Same litter as her last foster home (world's best, red bag)
- Clean it very time she pees
- Pheromones diffuser (been plugged in about 11 days)
- Pheromone spray into the litter
- Enzyme spray where she goes on the tile. She has not pooped anywhere else, not on the bathroom rugs or anywhere else in the house (except for once when she had urgent diarrhea wasn't able to make it to the bathroom in time)
- Fixed her diarrhea over the past couple days with pumpkin puree (thought maybe she wasnt going in there because she was uncomfortable)
- Gently talk to her all day asking her if she would please use the litter box and giving her positive affirmations

Sometimes if I catch her while she's about to go I'll put her in the litter box and she'll go in there mostly because she's about to poop so she doesn't have a choice. But then she is clearly upset with me afterwards.

I guess next I will try to cover the entire tile floor with a towel and maybe that will get her to go in there? How long do behavioral issues persist, I would have thought by now she'd be more comfortable in this new home, especially given she's playful and sweet with me otherwise.

BealsWrites,1634306173,q8oyo4,8,False,1,"I have two cats, one who is 7 with a variety of health problems, and one who is about 2. Because of my older cat‚Äôs health problems (including being overweight, in part due to the steroid pill he takes everyday), he has to stay on a diet of 1/2 cup of food a day (mostly dry). They both receive this amount, and my younger cat who is very healthy is fine with this. My older cat is NOT. I know it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs hungry, but maintaining his health through a diet is really important.

Anyways, about an hour before meal time (both breakfast and dinner), my older cat gets very verbal and starts hounding me for food. This I can handle, but he also starts bullying and attacking my younger cat. This is the only time they seriously fight, and the bullying often results in my younger cat running away while my older cat hunts him down. Occasionally my younger cat will retaliate and start attacking/hunting as well. When it starts happening, I typically separate them, putting whoever instigated the fight in a separate room.

I‚Äôve tried playing with them around this time, which typically helps, but spending an hour before each of their meals playing with them isn‚Äôt really realistic, especially since I work from home and typically prepare dinner right before they are fed. I feed them at the same time everyday, 10am and 10 pm.

Aside from this problem they are both very well behaved, but they don‚Äôt really spend time hanging out/cuddling. Is there a way to alleviate this fighting? Will feeding them 3 times a day help? Should I just add a little more food to their diet to stop the fighting?

Right now, my issue is that he won't stop crying bloody murder to go back out the moment he comes inside, from 6 PM-ish to whatever ungodly hour he hears someone still awake.

From a couple weeks after he came home with us, he started to ""play bite"" a lot, most often when we pet him. He never broke skin and it doesn't really hurt, so I know he is not trying to hurt us. Sometimes he grab my hand like he wants to bite it but if I don't resist, he will lick it intead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried 2 things to make him stop: hissing at him when he does it, or yelping in pain. He usually looks at me like ""how dare you!"" and bolt away (or try to bite again harder if I try to pet him again). So I think these methods have not been very successful so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of his biting, he is very affectionnate, super chill, he never hisses, never claws at us or anything like that.

bittersuitely,1634181134,q7r5mh,0,False,1,"Hi all! I have two cats that I've had for around 9 months. They're both around 7 years old and we named them after two of our favorite Star Wars characters: Ahsoka and Babu Frik (who we just call Babu).

Long story short, after we met and fell in love with both girls, we found out that Babu was mismarked as ""gets along with other cats"" and was a bit of a bully at her foster house (which wasn't the same house Ahsoka was at). My spouse and I both grew up with animals that didn't get along and found ways to create safe households, so we decided to keep the cats on separate floors and try to acclimate them to each other. If that didn't work then we'd keep them separated. Our living room and dining room is downstairs and our game room/office is upstairs, so the cats would always get ample time to be with us.

We followed all of the cat introduction guidelines and only recently got to a point where we felt okay letting them interact without being separated by a gate for extended periods of time -- with supervision and treats to reward them for good behavior.

Watching the girls interact, it's clear Babu's issues come from insecurity and anxiety. She's never been outwardly violent or aggressive, but she does go on the defensive and sometimes will stalk Ahsoka. 

This last week we've had pretty good luck getting them to coexist with minimal issue and I feel like we are so close to getting them to tolerate each other, but if we aren't around they'll eventually have a stand off. Today was a little rougher than usual, as well. During supervised visits Babu wouldn't leave Ahsoka alone and we ended up separating them with the gate sooner than usual.

I'm wondering if, since we keep the girls separated, they might view each floor as a separate territory they have to compete over. Do you all think that might be the issue? They each have food, water and litter boxes, but we only have one on each floor, so I'm wondering if I should have extras in each space. I also only have one cat tree on each floor, maybe I should invest in more elevated spaces/places to hide? Is there anything I might be missing? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

TLDR: I think the reason my one cat bullies the other is because she's insecure and doesn't view the whole house as one territory, but rather two separate spaces to compete over. Would it be beneficial to add more resources to each floor so she doesn't feel she has to compete?

First I need to start with some key information. Today is 10.8.21, I brought my Cat from California to Hawaii on 8.25.21. Which means around 10 hours on planes and in the airport. Very stressful day for my cat. For the last 2 1/2 years he has been a inside cat with no other animals. The new house that he lives in has a dog and a cat that he used to live with when he was a kitten. He is now able to go outside. The neighbor has around 15 cats, maybe more. 

Now, when I first moved here I had him in my room alone for about a week. He used the litterbox perfectly fine. His behavior was perfect. I started letting him outside and into the rest of the house around a week and a half after. I can't remember when he first peed on the bed but he didn't do it for a while. Over the last few weeks he has been exponentially increasing the frequency of his peeing. I have tried everything, I have gotten new cat boxes. Moved them to different locations. I have a feliway oil diffuser in the room. He has constant access to the outdoors which he loves. The room has been dog free for about 2 weeks now. I clean his litter box daily. I tried feeding him on the bed, it worked for a couple days but than he peed right next to his feeder. I have given him comfortable and high up places to sleep. Fed him in different locations, different water locations. I have no idea what to do.

I guess I'm writing this because in the event that this is not a medical issue I need help addressing this.

We want him to be an indoor cat and despite some loud protests at the back door, he's handling it well. Taking him for a walk in the evening to give him a bit of outside time seems to keep him happy for the following day. 

The problem has come in that he is a little monster to one of my flatmates. He has done nothing to provoke Poe that I've noticed, but Poe likes to jump up and bite the backs of his knees, and is just a little shit around him in general. Poe walks on leash great for me when it's just us or one of my other flatmates, but as soon as this flatmate is along, he's a misbehaving nightmare. 

We've tried to bond them with treats, play, walking, meal time, cuddles. He doesn't dislike my flatmate because he still readily accepts these things, but he also likes to misbehave in very serious ways that he just doesn't do with the other three of us. 

Additionally, Poe has recently been acting up more generally. Jumping on the counter, trying to bolt out the door, being loud at night. We've tried playing with him before bed (and many times throughout the day!) but he just doesn't play. He gives a few half hearted bats at the toys, but then gets grumpy and leaves.

My cats have always woken us up in the morning, but I'm at my wits end because it's started to get earlier and earlier I'm coming off 2 sleepless nights.

1 of my 2 cats is just ill behaved in so many ways. I feel like I made her this way and don't know how to undo it. 

* She will knock things off my nightstand, claw my feet, claw my hair to get fed. If I get up in the middle of the night to pee she thinks it's food time and all bets are off. 
* She likes to sleep on top of my back, and I think she's checking my breathing to see when I wake up so she knows as soon as I'm remotely stirring and she starts her campaign. 
* We can't lock her out (we do still do it sometimes) because she throws herself against the door. 
* We feed her 4x/day, the first feeding is in the morning as soon as we get up. I extremely regret ever getting into this habit.
* She is obsessed with food. She will climb on the back of the toilet while I'm on it to claw kleenexs out of the box, she scratches the couch when she wants to get fed (we feed her 4 times a day, small servings), she will get up in front of the TV when we're watching it and claw at it. It's like she's always obsessed with where the next food is coming from and can't focus on anything else. 
* We pay attention to her behavior and make it a point to feed her when she's not acting out to send the message that bad behavior doesn't lead to getting fed.
* She is overweight slightly, she has lost 7 ounces in the last two years with a lot of hard work (reducing how much dry food she eats, which she hates). Her vet is proud of her. 
* We play with her - we have lot of toys, and she plays with her sister (she's bigger than her sister and the alpha cat), and we have a climbing wall for her in the basement and a big cat castle. 

**My goal is for her to leave us alone when we're sleeping. What I'm trying:**

* We just ordered an automated feeder that works for both wet and dry foods that we will start trying in a few days. I will try setting the wet food timer for 6AM in the hopes that she will leave us alone to go eat. 

The thing I'm worried about is this cat is like endlessly obsessed with food - she's so persistent, I think after a few weeks she'll eat and come right back upstairs to bother us for her next feeding. I don't think she's hungry, I think she wants to know that her food is coming and have the sense of security her next feeding is happening.

s_rkeller,1633060796,pz02m8,2,False,1,"Hi all, long post so please bear with me. My ~12yo cat has been indoor/outdoor her whole life after I found her as a stray. She has pretty bad arthritis in both her knees and 3 weeks ago got into a nasty fight with another cat. Since then she has been limping very heavily on her back right leg. She has been seen by vets several times and was put on crate rest for 2 weeks and has been on some heavy pain control. Well 3 weeks later she is still limping severely and dealing with pain so she is still on crate rest. Now to my behavior problem, she is having an incredibly difficult time being stuck inside + on crate rest. I would probably allow her to roam free in the house at this point, but 1) she seems to get more worked up and paces between the doors crying and 2) she will not reliably use her litter box. How can I effectively litter train her/ make her life inside more enjoyable? 

Her setup right now is a large dog kennel (tried an X-pen but she tried climbing it which will set her back medically) with a bed on one side and a litter box taking up about 1/4 of the floor space. The litter box has low sides to accommodate her arthritis and uses corn litter to mimic dirt texture. She is primarily kept in there except for short ventures into the rest of the house. She will pee and poop on the floor most of the time, even with litter box access. Even with sedating pain meds, she cries all night in her kennel.

zzznkd,1633004434,pyimbi,2,False,1,"Hi there! 

My question is about potty training a young (about 4 months old) female cat. I'm writing this post on behalf of my girlfriend, so this is how she described the issue to me.

Her family took the cat in at about 4 weeks old, since the mother cat appeared to have stopped feeding her kittens rather early. My girlfriend even had to return the kitten to her mother for about a week since she wasn‚Äôt eating that well. After the kitten returned, she seemed to grasp the concept of where her tray was, but the problems started pretty much right away: she does go to her tray when she appears to have to go to the toilet, but then she almost always proceeds to climb out of it and then pee somewhere on the floor or even the clothes in some drawers. 

Here's what they already tried: 
- Several types of litter that is readily available (wood, clay, silica), even trying several combinations of those by stacking another tray on top of one type of litter and then layering on another type. Then they thought that the cat simply didn't like 'rocky' surfaces, so they only tried leaving the bottom layer or taking the litter out completely and just washing it regularly. That seemed to help for a week or so, but then this behaviour continued. 
- Tried litter training floor pads (as far as I understand it they're mainly used for dogs, but we still thought that might be a good idea as she was peeing all over the floors, but that only led to the cat peeing on the blankets as well, supposedly due to the similarities in texture). 
- Sprayed the places she did pee at with specialty repellent sprays and/or citrus-based homemade sprays AND used sprays that are supposed to attract cats to the litter trays. Didn't help either way. 
- In the first several weeks, my girlfriend tried to always observe her when she seemed to want to go to the toilet outside of the tray, move her there and then give her a treat for sticking to the tray, but that didn't reinforce any sort of positive behaviour in the cat. In fact, treats in general seem to never work at all since the kitten consumes a rather large amount of food for her size and age and treats mean little to her (which is apparently the same behaviour that her mother exhibits). 

This whole issue seems to ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù her general behaviour of being quite hyperactive (to the point where she‚Äôll run herself into panting several times a day) and disobedient (climbing on the tables and cupboards and not heeding any warnings), where non-violent training methods like hissing at her or simply changing the tone of voice that the older cat in the house seems to always understand don't work on her. The older cat is 9 years old and also female. She accepted the kitten and they play and spend time together, but the little one doesn‚Äôt seem to heed any warnings from the older cat either and they only make her more mad and hyperactive and she just proceeds to fight with the older cat. 
What can such a behaviour be a symptom of? As far as we can tell, she gets plenty of attention and affection from the family (i.e. pets and playtime) and she can be quite sweet herself as well, but then it‚Äôs like a switch flips on and she just does whatever she wants. 

What can be done to coax her, as it were, to start using the tray again? Is it possible that this behaviour can also point to something like an infection or a disorder?

schmyloh,1632932327,pxytx7,1,False,1,"My cat, Dandy (DSH  ~1.5 years, neutered, male), is very high energy and loves to play. He gets walked outside for 20-45 minutes daily in the morning and we do group playtimes wth all the cats with toys before they are fed twice a day.

We have another male cat, Loki (DSH, ~3.5 years, neutered) who loves to play with Dandy. They play a little rough, as cats do, but we welcome anything that can tire them out safely.

The problem is as they are playing, they chase each other through the house, hide to pounce on each other, and my partner and I become targets for Dandy. He jumps out of hiding spots and grabs our ankles, sometimes biting lightly. He is always pretty gentle, using soft paws and has never left a mark let alone broke the skin, it really doesn't even hurt. It really seems like he's just playing with us. But, its bad manners and annoying, and not something i want him to try with guests.

I dont think its under enrichment (though, correct me if I'm wrong!) because it seems to happen only when he's riled up from play with the other cat,  and not done out of boredom.

lucaatiel,1632266480,psurk0,1,False,1,"Hi all. Literally just found this sub and I need some help. The three things I list in my title may seem disconnected, but trust me they are all related. 

I adopted a second cat a few months ago. He's lovely and sweet but he has a serious problem with food and begging. The place I adopted him from was my old job, and people had a horrible habit of sharing food with the cats there. 

I've had cats my whole life, and I never give them my own food. So this is new behavior for me. I've never had a cat want human food, especially not like this. He doesn't just sit there and expect food to fall. He climbs over us, on the table or counters, or gets on his hind legs and claws on our thighs. He pushes his face right into our plates if he gets close enough. I push him away, pick him off the counter or table, etc. We always use the same phrases and tones to tell him ""down"" or ""off"". I admit I've flicked his ear a few times when he has pushes his face fast into a bowl of mine, and after over a month of this my girlfriend got a spray bottle despite my not wanting one, but I understood because it was desperate. The way he acts makes cooking stressful, as he tries to get into and on everything. He could eat something bad, get sick from something, or even burn himself on the hot stove or pans. 

A few times, while cooking, he gets so agitated. I THINK he gets anxious. Anxious we won't give him any, anxious about the smells and the sounds. Anxious that we take him away. And he just... squats down to poop on the couch or floor in the living room. 

Today, it wasn't even cooking. We ordered some sandwiches and we sat down to eat. He wanted it bad and he hadn't eaten because it wasn't their feeding time yet (This was at around 6, and we usually feed at 6:30-7). He gets between us on the couch and starts craning his neck to get to mine and I used my hand to just push him back away from the coffee table. After that, he squats right there in between us. 

Sorry to ramble but this has been somewhat of a nightmare for us. 

Does anyone have any idea what could be the cause of this? Is he just anxious? Do I not feed him enough and he's just that hungry? Is he mad? I've tried OTC ""natural"" anxiety remedies following the theory that this may all be stress (his last owner claimed he was anxious, and I believe it) but is there anything else I could do? any method to stop this behavior? How can I get him to stop wanting human food entirely? 

Also, just so it's known, he is scheduled for another appointment in early oct. He was checked out right before I adopted him in May. He is hyperthyroid (on methimazole) and has a history of urinary issues so his main food is Purina UR. Also, he will behave like this regardless of if he has eaten his own mean yet or not. 

We also have tried 2 toys so far to slow feed some UR dry food and treats to keep his attention. It only placates him for a bit.",CatTraining,"Advice for food begging, anxiety, and pooping."

I dropped him off but they called me panicked around 12 because he attacked the nurses and wasn't calming down. I rushed to pick him up, he calmed down as soon as he saw me (no hissing or growling) and took him home to feed him his favorite snack. The next day, my friend (a woman) came over.

I have two cats, Rooney and Sprout. Rooney is five, and Sprout is 3. They have lived together peacefully since Sprout was a kitten. 

Three weeks ago, I was upstairs when I heard horrific hissing, yowling, and fighting. I ran downstairs, and the two of them were locked together in a terrible fight. Rooney appeared to be the one attacking Sprout - when I managed to separate them, Sprout was scrambling to get away, and Rooney was trying to go after her. I immediately separated them, and have been attempting to follow Jackson Galaxy's reintroduction process for the last three weeks (we have neighbour cats who hang around, and I'm guessing this is a case of redirected aggression). I swap the blankets they sleep on every day, I feed them together, and I give treats/pets when they are friendly to each other. I also swap them in and out of the rooms the other has been occupying, so they are very familiar with each other's scents. 

There have been improvements - in the immediate aftermath, they would lock eyes, growl, hiss, and generally not like being in the same room. Since then, they are eating totally fine together, I have been playing with them at the same time, and they sleep in the same room fairly frequently. They are often able to walk around and past each other without incident (with us keeping an eye on them). They occasionally sniff at each other and move on. 

However, as soon as I think things are getting better, something happens. For instance, this morning Rooney ran to the window, and Sprout thought he was charging her, so she hissed and ran away. Rooney seems fine most of the time, but he will randomly meow at her and raise his paw - when we were playing the other day, he lashed out a bit (I then immediately separated them). I keep Sprout in the basement during the night (with her own litter box, toys, etc), but when she scratches at the door, Rooney will come over and essentially attack, hiss, and meow at her. He does not typically do this when he has full view of her, only when he can't or partially see her. Things seem to have plateaued over the last two weeks. I have a vet visit planned, but they‚Äôve been totally normal for the past three weeks (besides the above incidences). 

I guess my questions are these:

- Does it seem as if things are progressing in a favourable direction?
- Does anyone have any personal experiences with this sort of situation? If so, what did you do, how long did it take for them to becomes friends again?

Aside from a couple of escapes, the first week involved us isolating them and rewarding our resident cat every time he investigated the door that our new kitten was behind. We did room swaps for 30 minutes - 1 hr at a time a few times and also moved some blankets/towels our new kitten laid on to the resident cat's territory.

The hissing seemed to slow down so we started introducing the kitten to my resident cat by holding the kitten near the resident cat. No hissing from our resident cat, general meows and what not (lots of treats were given during this process.)

However, we've noticed that whenever we set the kitten down (e.g. to play on the cat tree) or if he escapes from his isolation room he tries to charge our resident cat. The resident cat will jump up on something and hiss. We have not reached the situation where both end up fighting thankfully.

Particularly, we want her to not consider biting or scratching our hands and feet to induce playtime. We only got one cat, and it's a constant struggle to find ways to stimulate her. Her toys are good for her playing by herself, and we have multiple toys that have a wand where we can play with her, but she seems to want US to play with her. She'll hop on our calves or hands (no teeth or claws) in a playful way and I think it's completely healthy that she wants to play with the other people in the house.

Are there ways to play with her more directly without her developing problematic tendencies? For example, we've been considering getting a hand puppet to give her the crazy play time she's looking for our of us or will that just cause her to attack us more often when the puppet isn't on our hands?

JimmyRecard51,1631719848,posenu,12,False,1,"So my cat Riker is a bit of a lunatic. I got him as a kitten, almost 4 years ago. He was off the walls crazy at the time, and after 2 weeks of it I decided to adopt his sister Beverly (same litter) because I had read that having a playmate might chill him out a bit. He immediately established himself as the dominant one, mauling her every chance he had. I thought I made a mistake but he did actually chill out quite a bit after about a week of that, and the two of them have a good relationship to this day.

Some things to note about him: He is a very needy boy. Super affectionate and generally mild mannered, but sometimes (once or twice a day) he gets a look in his eye and he needs to run full speed around the house, attack his toys, or sometimes, rarely, attack Beverly. 

Things had been fine overall until about a year ago when I moved in with my girlfriend. She had just adopted a cat, Georgia, who was declawed from her last owners and a TRUE scaredy cat by nature. I moved my cats in and things were rocky from the get go, obviously. Once they got used to each other there were some peaceful moments, ie warily hanging out on the bed together. We would try to encourage their nice behavior with treats. But soon Riker started attacking her and it became pretty frequent. It would happen out to the blue in his bouts of wildness, but also when we would spend time with Georgia (particularly on the bed) as he gets very jealous. Generally my go to move is to grab him by the scruff, give him some strong words and put him in the bathroom as punishment. Admittedly I'm not sure now if that has been a good idea since it doesn't seem to phase him. 

 We tried giving him extra attention and toys, and he soaks it up, but once the craziness hits him it's obvious. He will usually approach her and kind of cry at her, and she hisses aggressively at him, which I think sets him off even more. This is when we usually step in but sometimes we're too late and he manages to scratch her face. We tried getting the pheromone plugin to chill everyone out but it had no noticeable effect. 

We resorted to putting him on prozac, which did seem to have an effect. We had him on it for probably 2 or 3 months and while there was still tension between them, he wasn't trying to murder her anymore, so we took him off of it. Things have kind of stagnated since then. We kept thinking they'd just need more time together, but now it's been a year and we feel like we haven't made much progress. He still occasionally goes after her and it makes me so upset, cause I feel like it undoes any progress we make when they are being good together. We are strongly considering putting him back on prozac but I wanted to reach out to this community for advice first.

ontopofyourmom,1631588597,pnuil6,1,False,1,"Spike (yet again) lives with me and my girlfriend. I have a lot more time and interest in training than she does. She is very supportive and wants to help, but it stresses her out to remember what I'm working on with him. Worrying about whether she's ""doing it right"" stresses her out even more.

This is okay with me. She is great with Spike and doesn't do anything counterproductive. She just doesn't reinforce behaviors the way I do. This is also okay. Her well-being is more important to me than anything having to do with the cat.

But I would like to train him more.

I haven't walked him frequently before this week. She does it in the morning while I'm still asleep. Just follows him around the garden and front yard. He's not interested in going more than twenty or thirty feet down the sidewalk either way from the house. He'd rather stop and smell the roses and hide in the bamboo and do all of the wonderful things cats do outdoors. Again, OK.

But I want to teach him to go on walks with me. Among other things, that means staying on the sidewalk even when someone else's yard looks appealing. I've noticed that simply not letting him walk off of the sidewalk will probably be enough, but my girlfriend simply isn't going to reinforce this. She wants to help but hasn't internalized the fact that absolute consistency is as important as it is. 

From reading and experience, I know that it is both trivial and good to signal to a cat that it's training time. Something as small as getting out the treats can be enough (treats are only for training in this house!) and he also knows what my ""training toolbox"" (that is never used) is for.

I'd like to have an olfactory signal that I can use at any time, including outdoors. I think that will especially help him distinguish between outdoor exploration and play on one hand and training on the other.

So after all of that:

What are some smells that a) cats like and b) will not often encounter on their own?

For example, Spike loves the smell of smoky scotch whiskey. Enough that he dips his nose in my glass while trying to get a whiff. But I don't want to send him the ""training"" signal when all I want to do is have a drink.

Are there any other unusual odors that might work? I had a plan to use vanilla, but I'd prefer something a little less common.

ontopofyourmom,1631586815,pnu1k3,4,False,1,"Many of you are familiar with the scoff/cough vocalization that means ""I'm frustrated"" or ""you're annoying me.""

(I couldn't quickly find a link, but I'm not sure anybody could discuss this if they weren't already familiar with the sound and associated behavior.)

First things first, I don't think there is any problem here. I'd just love to hear some feedback from somebody who understands cat behavior and psychology better than I do.

I first started hearing Spike (6 mo Bengal) scoff when I was trying to see how high he could jump during play. I just used a wand toy and gradually moved it higher and higher. When it got too high for him (too high meaning ""a foot lower than he can actually jump""), he would start scoffing and keep it up until he finally jumped. 

After some observation and reading, it became clear to me that he was instinctually compelled to jump but did not want to. Fair enough. I stopped doing it because there is no reason for me to annoy my cat just so I can brag about how high he can jump. 

I also sometimes get a small scoff during training and play where his desires and instincts are at odds.

So I listen to him. I don't want him to associate me with frustration. 

I was taking him for a walk around the yard today and he was scoffing up a storm every time his efforts to catch a fly were unsuccessful. 

This leads me to think it's ordinary and natural behavior in natural settings and probably isn't at all upsetting outside of the moment.

Am I right about this? I'll still avoid annoying him, because he is my friend and I like him. I guess I just want to know more about this behavior.",CatTraining,Scoffing

Nobz81,1631518429,pnas07,3,False,1,"Hi guys I have a question regarding my situation. 

I have two cats, they're 7 years old, sisters. They tolerate each other but don't really get along very well. They grew up in my old house, for a period of time when I (obviously) lived there too. It's a pretty big house, where they're free to come and go, to roam and to hunt in the countryside.

In the last year or so I pretty much moved to another town, where my girlfriend and her daughter live, 45-50 minutes of distance, in an apartment without garden. I still come back to my old house and sleep there 2 days a week, and in the rest of the time my dad, who lives upstairs, takes care of the cats (they're pretty indipendent, he almost only feeds them).

In the 2 days I come back they definitely act like they're really happy to see me, and it really seems like they missed me (I know maybe it's projection, but it really feels that way).

So, what would be the best course of action:

\-let them live there like they're used to, they may be sad that I'm not there all the time (I'm a bit sad too :) ), but it's the best for them (I tend to believe it's the best solution, but I'm asking for a more informed opinion).

\-bring them with me during the weekend, to help them get to know the new place, and the two new humans, then bring them to their old home during the week (but it seems to me it could be too much stress for them, since the trip it's 45 minutes)

\-move them completely (but it seems a bit dangerous for the apartment, when we're out for most of the day).

I've made a few other posts here on Reddit about introducing my cats and I still need advice lol. I adopted a 4-month-old Tuxedo cat (we named him Tux) about 10 days ago. I have a Calico (named Mini) that is 1 year old. For the past week or so, I have kept the new kitten in his own room and were feeding him and Mini through either sides of the door. I then advanced and started feeding them through a cracked door and Mini would hiss when Tux was too close.

I also did scent swapping. I would take Tux's beds and swap them with Mini's. I even rubbed Tux's scent on socks and towels and put them where Mini would be. Mini went into Tux's room twice. I also had Tux roam the house while Mini was in another room a few times. The problem is Tux, is anxious to get out of his room.

This morning, I decided that it would be okay to let Tux out while supervised with Mini. (I decided this because even though Mini would hiss at Tux through the door, she spent a lot of her time just sitting close to his room even with the door closed and bc I Mini appeared used to his scent).

Mini hissed at Tux and ran into the basement. When I went to check on her in the basement, she was looking out the window and not hiding. After some coaxing, I got her to come up the stairs and have her and Tux eat treats together. Mini hissed when Tux tried to get closer to her. Eventually Mini went back into the basement after she ate her treats. Tux was out for about 3 hours before I put him back in his room.

I had purchased a baby gate and put that up in Tux's room with the door open. But it only took a few seconds before Tux jumped over it lol. I took the gate down and closed the door and I don't know how but Tux opened the door by himself!

Anyways, I got Tux to stay in his room and with some coaxing I got Mini to come up from the basement and back into the living room and I played with her. What do I do now?

we introduced them tonight, and it went okay...ish? we put up a baby gate, pretty much down the center of the house, and let them look at each other after both were immediately comfortable playing on opposite sides of a door. the minute the cat could see the dog, he fixated on the dog. like would not stop staring. we sat on opposite sides of the fence with our respective animals and fed them bits of treats when they got close to the other with no negative reaction. the only incident was when my girlfriend opened the gate and the dog slipped through to follow her, and the kitten swiped.

Now context, this is a stray 4-6 week old kitty (we think it is female btw), that we found yesterday below our car, scarred and crying.  
She probably got lost from her stray mother, we also suspect that she was already in this situation the day before, because we did hear some noises previously coming from below the car (parked near work).

We are STILL deciding if we are going to keep the cat, we probably will, but NOT 100% sure.

As I m writing this, the first night had me awake till 5:30 am, to make sure the cat was sleeping and then she awaked me at 7 am when she came to snuggle to me at bed (I was expecting this so I actually sleep outside my bed covers lol)

I m very much aware it is a baby we are talking about, thus this is normal, but that doesn't mean it is impossible to solve, at least for the other first nights of his.

Obviously, I m worried since I want to be able to leave her on her bed and go to sleep myself, I managed to work her out last night, but took almost 1 hour.

The cat slept in my bedroom the first night, but I want to avoid repeating that, it is a BIG NO, also considering the stuff I have around cables, and other fragile stuff.  
(was never fond of having pets sleeping with me at night)

The plan is to have the cat used to sleep in her bed, in the hall, near the kitchen, there is enough space there, and we need ways to get that to work ASAP while avoiding her feeling scared at night.

TOPIC OF THE TITLE:  
Finally to the topic of the title, I know cats, in general, go crazy for catnip, if I put/sprayed some in her bed tomorrow before we go to sleep, would it help?  
I mean could she even try to sleep surround by the scent?  
There is also the point that I have heard we should not rely on catnip too much, a cat's exposure to it should be balanced.

When I woke yesterday, I never imagined a kitty would show up, so we lack proper toys, bed, and litterbox, we had to improvise, a good toy would also go a long way, because otherwise, my arm will fall off, from trying to deplete all of this energetic kitty batteries.

Thank you to everyone that read to the end, and if you have any valuable advice to share about this situation, it would be much appreciated. :)

PS: I know cats are far from restless, my dad owned a female cat, she sadly dies earlier this year... when I visited him many times over the years, I got to play with her, she become very fat, she would have survived longer than 14 years otherwise (I always warned them this was BIG PROBLEM).

It was sad, but I m used to loss, like most people are, we had it much worst when the 14y old female dog we had, had to be put to sleep seven years ago, that was definitely one of the most traumatic experiences in my life, that we tough it out, and are proud we could do the right thing when the time was right. (cancer got her, at first lightly, once she lost most of her movement and needed diapers it got even worst fast, it reached a point that we realized it was not a comfortable life for her, and my mental health was getting worst fast, thus we did her right and stuck near her, to the end, and now many years later, I can look back to everything, cry but also feel very fond of all the memories we had together)

It took a long time to accept the idea of having pets again, but I have the good experiences with my dad's old cat, that I know since she was very small, a little kitty, as they grow, they are supposed to calm down, I know these times are critical in this little kitten live, and that with time it will get better and it will adapt, and these first nights will turn out to be most pleasant in the long run.  
If we keep this adorable kitty, we want its happiness, and also making sure to avoid common traps and raise it to the most well-behaved cat we can.

But again, I would like to sleep a bit the nights to come, thus any advice would be appreciated, many thanks.",CatTraining,"Can I use catnip to get my kitten to sleep on his bed, on his first few nights?"

He also has a huge problem with eating our food if we leave it unattended for even a second.

The reason I am worried about counters and tables is because we often use the stove and make coffee, and I would hate for him to jump on top of the hot stove and burn himself, or jump on the table and spill some hot coffee. We also have rats that we keep in our room, and he surprisingly enough leaves them alone for the most part and seems to not care about them, but it is part of the reason we would like for him to stay out of our room. It would be very easy for him to crawl behind the washer that we cannot move, which is why we do not want him in the laundry room.

No amount of removing him from the places we do not want him has seemed to get it through to him that these are things he cannot do. Whenever we try to simply keep him locked out of our room, he meows and cries at the door unless we let him in. He will literally do it all night. As for trying to eat our food, I make sure he always has food and water available for whenever he is hungry, so I know he is not trying to eat our food because he is hungry.

Does anyone have any tips or tricks for training him to avoid these behaviors?

schmyloh,1631123576,pkfk62,2,False,1,"Hello, I have a cat who is a rescued stray. He's indoor-only except for harnessed walks. He's really good about wearing his harness, he doesn't slink while it's on, doesn't seem to mind it at all. He's extremely high energy and I usually walk him once a day for between 20 and 45 minutes so that his energy will be more manageable in the house.

The way our walks currently go is he either indicates he wants out by meowing at the door, or I decide he needs a walk and pick up his harness and call for him. I put his harness on and he walks out the door by himself when I open it. After that, he spends a good 5-20 minutes just hanging around the upper landing of our apartment building (on some shorter walks we literally do not go downstairs). We have some catnip and wheat grass growing out there so he usually gives them  a sniff/nibble, then just kind of meanders/lays around. Eventually he will go over to the steps and indicate he wants to go down them. We go down them. Then he kind of meanders and sniffs around the apartment complex.

When he wants to go places he's not allowed (places that are dangerous or where I can't follow) I will tighten his leash and not allow him. Usually when this happens, he will lie down and not move until I pick him up and put him down somewhere else. I can never get him to walk somewhere he doesn't choose to go, and when we are done walking I have to scoop him up and walk him upstairs, which I don't like doing because he doesn't like being held, and while he doesn't bite or scratch he does grumble and wiggle and I know he doesn't like it.

Is there a way I can train him that taught leash=change directions instead of stop a lie down? Is there a way I could train him to make his own way home instead of having to be carried? He is clicker trained and I do use treats on walks sometimes to lure him, but he doesn't always seem interested in treats when on walks. I'd be willing to try with something higher value, but before I do that I'd like to know what I'm doing. He does seem to enjoy the walks and they're definitely good at making him more manageable, I just wish I could make ending them less unpleasant for him.",CatTraining,Train to walk where i want?

Laid one of her scratching posts on its side in the main room and she loves it. Thinks my plants are toys to kick over?

Rebl__,1631024309,pjnyre,8,False,1,"I recently moved in to a three bedroom apartment with a couple of close friends, one of whom owns a cat who is a 7 y/o male.  I grew up with two cats in my household and I was excited to live with a cat again but there are some behavioral issues I‚Äôve never experienced before.

The little guy meows for an hour straight both before and after his meal times, which means 7 - 9 AM he is raising hell since he gets breakfast at 8 and 4 - 6 PM he starts raising hell again since he eats dinner at 5.  When his owner isn‚Äôt around to feed him personally he has an automatic feeder he loads in the morning.

His owner also frequently spends entire days away from the apartment (not an exaggeration, we are talking leaves at 7 am and is back at 1 - 4am) and on those days his cat will meow starting from around midnight to whenever he eventually comes home.

My first thought was that he was just getting settled in to the new place and was stressed, but then I learned that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just always done this‚Äù.  Apparently the owner‚Äôs dad is a very early riser and when the cat would be left at the parents house when his owner was out of town etc. he would be fed whenever he caused a ruckus, even at 5AM.

To further complicate the issue his cat has some urinary issues and is required to eat prescription food for the rest of his life so the medical issue causing it because of discomfort or something can‚Äôt be ruled out.

It normally wouldn‚Äôt be that much of an issue, but this cat can really MEOW.  I sleep with -40dB ear plugs and it‚Äôs the only sound that has ever been able to wake me up through them.  With this happening some days in the dead of night and also again early in the morning I‚Äôm losing some serious sleep.

We resorted to trying to untrain the behavior using a squirt bottle after talking with his owner and getting it ok‚Äôd, but that isn‚Äôt working.  It‚Äôs turned the routine into meow-hide-get squirted-repeat instead of helping at all.

I then read online that a cat‚Äôs stomach can get upset if they go longer than 12 hours between meals so I brought it up to his owner and he adjusted his feeding schedule so he eats the same overall amount of food but in 3 portions instead of 2 now at 8, 4, and midnight but that has just resulted in 3 guaranteed meowing sessions so in a way it‚Äôs made the problem worse.

I‚Äôm at a complete loss for ideas here.  I know some cats are just vocal breeds but at the bare minimum I need to find a way to where it isn‚Äôt destroying my sleep schedule.

littlegreen94,1630682208,ph77dn,7,False,1,"Hey friends!

A couple of nights ago, I took in a semi-feral kitten when the hurricane hit New York. Her mother is a socialized barn cat (and LOVES people/children) and has had many litters (all have been successfully socialized). The woman who was feeding this kitten says her kids have been playing with her and she was nervous around people but was warming up. 

This kitten is FEISTY. She got a clean bill of health from the vet but she is absolutely an angry little baby. She bit me HARD multiple times when I was trying to remove the bandage from her leg from her blood draw. I‚Äôm now on antibiotics. She‚Äôs terrified of my hands. I have been able to pet her when she eats but as soon as she realizes it‚Äôs my hand petting her, she hisses and swats at it. She is also spitting at me quite a bit. 

I have not been successful trying to pick her up with a towel. She gets very violent. 

However, I think she likes when I sit next to her crate because whenever I walked away last night she starting screaming. She would stop when I went back. She has also realized that we have other cats and really wants to be close to them, but I am waiting a few extra days to make sure she really has a grasp on the litter box before letting her walk around the house. She runs to the front of the crate when she sees or hears one of them, so I am hopeful about her integration into our cat family. 

Has anyone experienced such violence before and eventually had success with socialization? Her mother is fully socialized and loves children, so I don‚Äôt think she picked up fear of humans from her mother. Is she just really scared?

Supersssnek,1630403139,pf2kxb,6,False,1,"This will probably be very long, but I want to give all the info on this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I adopted the cutest little girl from my local shelter just before summer. She is spayed. She lived the first two years of her life as a feral cat, and the next two in the shelter where they worked on socializing her. So she's four, and most of the info online on how to socialize feral cats are aimed at kittens so I don't know what my best approach would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is a bit of a hissy girl, but she doesn't really ""do"" anything more than hiss, she runs away if she's uncomfortable. Sometimes she'll slap me with her paw if I get too close and don't listen to her warnings but mostly she'll just run away.

&amp;#x200B;

I have mostly just let her be since she got here, or at least physically. She accepts my presence as long as I keep a bit of distance or move slowly. If I walk towards her she hides, and if I reach my hand out to her she also runs to hide. However, she still follows me around the apartment and seems to be protecting me when I'm in the bathroom and stuff. She also listens when I call her cause that means there's probably treats for her. She has stopped hissing almost completely when I bring her food, and if I move slowly when she's in one of the cat trees she'll smell my hand before turning away. I am still not allowed to touch her though. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to say is that she's not a regular house cat but doesn't seem entirely feral either. And because of that I don't know how to move forward with her in the best way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feed her twice a day and sometimes I stay by the food and she'll still come to eat. I have just started experimenting with where she draws the line on my presence when she eats, she doesn't seem to mind me as much when there's food around. She has one litterbox in the bathroom and one in the livingroom, several hides I have bought, but I have removed the space under the bed and other furniture. She does relax and lay on her back in the cat trees, but will sit up as soon as she hears me move at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are moving in November, so I have started her on something called anxitane that I plan on using until a bit after we've moved. I also have feliway spray and the one you plug in the outlet. I was thinking of letting her move in to the bathroom with all of her stuff and get cozy for a week or so before letting her out in the rest of the apartment, but I was wondering if the bathroom would be a good place to try to get her more okay with touch? I have seen people recommend both not touching the cat until it comes to you, and desensitizing by touching until they stop caring and I don't know what I could have the most luck with with her.

Unfortunately, the old man passed and the cat colony got out of hand. (None of the cats were his they were all strays). 
So my mum and her friend contacted various organisations who helped with desexing all the cats and rehoming the kittens and some cats. But 5 were not rehomed and taken back to the property, which mum/friend have been feeding, petting, holding, cuddling daily. 

I recently moved into my own place and  offered to take 2 (m/f) as the property is to be sold and redeveloped. 

Obviously the move was a bit traumatic for the cats. We have given the cats free roam of the garage and set up various beds, boxes, blankets, litter box, food/ water stations. 
Initially we left the cats alone only going in to the garage to check they were okay. They seemed to settle really well and were letting us pat them. The female cat was even walking between my legs and lurking around dinner time when I was putting their food out. They even came into the house for a quick inspection. 

Then a week ago their moods changed completely. Both cats have been sitting on top of the garage door and won‚Äôt come down until nighttime and then in the morning when we first go to check they scurry back to the top of the garage door. 
The male cat has not stopped growling, spitting, hissing &amp; swiping at us even when we are far away. We can‚Äôt get close unless we are hand feeding him pur√©e treats.

I am wondering if anyone has done Prozac with their cat and what their results ended up being, how fast the results kicked in, how did your cat react, etc... we are starting Prozac tonight (I think night will be an easier time to give her but please correct me if you guys suggest another time)  


We got a puppy for Christmas last year after fostering for 5 months (foster had to go back to original owner). My 12 year old cat (Aura) had been fine with Leo (foster) just didn't want to interact with him. Now, she was fine with Ivy (puppy) for the first 5-6 months and then it just started going downhill. She became very anxious around Ivy (Ivy barks at her ever since she caught Aura eating out of her food bowl). We got her a trainer that we are working with to have her chase Aura less which is working albeit not perfect yet (she's 10 months old now).   


About 4 months ago Aura started peeing -everywhere- ... she had never done this before. Peeing on the couch, any clothing left on the ground, even the hardwood floor bare (which is the most common). We used multiple different types of enzyme cleaners (nature's miracle, simple solution, and resolve to name a few) and a bissell crosswave to remove all the urine (smell seems to be completely gone) though she still will pee in the area. We also tried all forms of pheromones we could find (Feliway both regular and multicat, also relaxivet) to zero effect.  


After some initial panic we took her to the vet thinking it was a UTI or something along those lines and spend $800 on tests for her trying to sort it out. They found nothing, urine is perfect, blood is perfect, senior analysis on both urine and blood was perfect, chest xray was perfect, no diabetes, nada. They did find some Feline Tooth Resorption which cost a whopping $1700 to extract those teeth but she had her surgery and there are no more issues with that and unfortunately after a few days of not peeing directly after the removal she went back to her habits.  


During the last 3 months they have put her on 2 different medications: one I forget the name of that was a light painkiller/anti anxiety, Zylkene (which only seemed to slightly lessen the issue and very slightly), and now we are moving to Prozac.

About five days ago, I had just fed my two cats (who have lived together for the past three years as best friends) and gone upstairs to get ready for work, when I heard insane hissing noises.

But I appreciate the nuance of different situations make tailored advice more useful. 

We have a Bengal who is well trained to be walked on a lead. We take him every evening for 30-60 minutes. Which is usually fine. It's not always at exactly the same time. As it depends on when I get home from work, prep dinner. Sit down for a bit and wait for it to get a bit dark (as he prefers that and seems to be less scared than when it's light).

The routine involves me getting home, having dinner, he has dinner, I chill and then take him out. However for the 2 hours during this whole time he is meowing CONSTANTLY. It's irritating, loud, puts my blood pressure up and it's stressful.

1. I wonder what I can incorporate in that routine to make him realise he needs to wait patiently. 

2. Trying to train him out of the meowing is difficult. Do I just not take him out if he is meowing? But then he doesn't stop. Or do I take him out at the same time each evening but that would be rewarding the meowing. 

3. Currently I say a stern 'NO!' each time he meows, and then eventually put him in a room where he has a litter box and I go to the living room to watch TV. That usually calms him down.

We have 3 cats- 2 are separated from 1 as they are hostile to him. We live in a small condo and it‚Äôs been very difficult and we‚Äôve had a few awful attacks that have resulted in injuries. 

We tried the Jackson Galaxy introduction process for many months with no success.

Went to the vet as a last resort. Apparently the vet can‚Äôt prescribe anxiety medication and referred us to a behaviorist. 

There is only one certified behaviorist in all of South Florida. Our initial visit was thorough and cost $650. We knew about the cost prior and had to save up for months. At the appointment, the doctor basically said that the preferred option is to just keep them separated forever. I would really like to not give up and to move forward because it‚Äôs uncomfortable for all of us to live like this with the cats permanently separated. Our space isn‚Äôt big enough, and it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to the cats. The behaviorist put them on Reconcile, but in order to medicate them we first need to do a full blood panel which would have cost an additional $700 for 2 cats at our appointment. Thinking it might be cheaper to have our vet do it, we opted to leave without it, but when I called the estimate from the vet was over $1000.

So at least $1400 out of pocket before any type of behavior training. The behavior training would start in November and would cost about $175 per online appointment.

I absolutely, absolutely adore her. I spend as long as I can (up to an hour at a time) playing with her and then many other hours stroking her and cuddling her.

I often have to stay up quite late in order to fit in work which I just HAVE to do, however, Vera finds this to be beyond reproach.

I rescued my cat when she was 6 months, found her in the streets, she wanted to come home with us, so we thought she was a lost cat. Long story short, after months of looking, we never found her owner, so I kept her.

Since I moved to London, my cat has been going out daily, to our garden area. She loves it. She seems to need it not to be bored to death.

We moved to the countryside, where she has been going out equally, but a couple of problems have started appearing.

One, she fights A LOT. Comes home with open wounds that then I have to clean and disinfect. It changes her mood for days. She becomes a rude and aggressive animal after having been out fighting. And I am very concerned that she could get a serious illness.

Two, I am thinking about buying a flat, with no option to go outdoors as it doesn't have a garden area.

My question is, would it be cruel to make her an indoor cat? To stop letting her out at all? If I'm home and she's in, she will cry in front of the door for hours and I end up opening the door for her to leave for a couple of hours.

I rescued a kitty that was abandoned by his mum at around 4-5 weeks. He was weaned much, much too early. I love him dearly, but he is kind of nuts. 

The main problem we are experiencing is with him is his desire for the flesh of human and canine appendages. This is not aggression, but play. Both humans in the house hate it and the dog hates it more. The dog really likes the cat until he starts chewing away on his paws and tail. As a result, the dog won't sleep with us anymore in our bed or on his own bed because he's avoiding the cat. The cat chewing is really painful and it's really affecting my dogs stress level. Like I said, we as humans have this issue, too. The kitten is definitely in charge of all of us and I would like a ceasefire. 

Things we've tried:
Misdirection towards a more suitable activity and play
Removing our/the dogs appendages and disengaging from the situation
Saying no and rewarding with treats when he sits (he won't take the treats out of our hand and by the time we've set them down for him, he's already bolted off somewhere else)
Picking him up by the scruff, calmly saying ""no"" and placing him in a more suitable area such as a scratching post or near an interactive toy (I like this approach the least, I'm still not convinced this is a great idea)

My cat was getting into my neighbor's backyard from under the fence, so I held on tight to his leash. (I can enter their lawn around the fence, but I would rather not)
(My cat wears a harness attached to the leash) My cat kept going in deeper and deeper, and so I tried pulling more and more. I did jerk the leash a couple of times too. 

My cat at this point was inside my neighbor's yard, and I decided to walk in and pick him up; as I had him in my arms, my cat hissed and scratched me and walked back to their lawn.

My partner got Ollie over the pandemic from the pound and he was a pretty good cat when he was much smaller but now he's being an absolute terror. He scratches the bed despite having a scratching post in the same room, he scratches speaker cabinets (different room, also with a scratch tower which he will use sometimes). He gets on the counters and on my desk which he is not allowed to do. We have been putting him in a ""penalty box"" (a laundry room with litter box and everything) for a time out when he does something we don't like, hoping that the lack of attention will deter the behavior.

I've got a 4-month old kitten and I'm clicker training him. I want to take him on adventures eventually - and of course whenever I have treats in my pocket / his treat bag our he goes a little bonkers. I started wearing his treat bag around the house even when I'm not treating him. 


He also won't play at much at play time because he wants treats. I figure he'll get used to this eventually but I've never trained a cat before. 

Perhaps more importantly, while he doesn't go bonkers any more, his behaviour has taken a step back. He doesn't respond to his recall command or get in his crate unless I have a treat in hand. I'm not sure if it's because I have been treating him a more often (e.g consistent vs intermittent conditioning) or if it's because he isn't listening because there are always treats around.

ysaid99,1628082216,oxs8ky,18,False,1,"Hoping some knowledgeable cat experts can help! I've never owned a cat. 

I am currently cat sitting my friend's cat, who was dropped off 3 nights ago and has about a week to go until his owners get back from their trip. We got given a clean litter box and dry and wet food. I've been duly scooping and feeding and all going well on that front. Also not sure if I would need to buy more litter to replace in the next 7 days? Anyway, what isn't going well is night time...

We work during the day, but I took a day on Monday to ease him in where I only went out for an hour or so. I went out and bought some cat toys so he had something to play with, both jingly ball and wand type, and give him a good play session in the evening for at least 30/40 mins, refresh his food and water and hope for the best as I go to bed. He is lying down looking tired and doesn't want to play any more when we do the food.  

After about 10 mins you hear him playing again which is fine and he settles down after a bit, and then around 2am he gets up and uses the litter box (loudly which wakes us all as it's not a big apartment), then around 4am he is fully awake, yowling and scratching the bed (bought him a scratching post in a futile attempt to save our leather sofa), attacking his reflection in the mirror and trying to knock things off shelves and biting our feet and hands. I tried to shut the bedroom door to ignore it but he was slamming his whole body against it so relented and opened it (I know...).

I know it's a big change in environment for him and he is probably a bit stressed, but when we are up he is super affectionate, chirpy and loving. I guess I just need some help and advice before I literally lose my mind. TIA.",CatTraining,Cat Sitting - Losing my mind
Mme_Mae,1628003110,ox5c8b,59,False,1,"Exactly as the title says. It sounds goddamn insane, but he is. Please read the whole thing, I genuinely welcome advice but I am borderline about giving him up to a farm because this is *disgusting* and becoming a health hazard, and I simply can't afford constantly ruined furniture/floors 

For starters- I have taken him to a vet.  Repeatedly. To three seperate vets to make sure.  There is NOTHING physically wrong with him. He does not eat things he shouldn't (stomach exam and all food cupboards have child locks). Nothing that would cause this puking. We've tried four several diets, we tried raw, we tried a very specific vet kibble/wet mix, etc. We are back on a hairball control/easy digestion formula and I'm effectively just keeping it at that because clearly diet isn't what's doing this. 

He has enrichment. He has so many toys. He has three cat trees. Several cat scratchers. Three moving water bowls around the house. He has a cat friend and they get along. She does not puke like this. I do not use anything scented in my home as I also get migraines from chemical scents. I now have SIX litter boxes- of different kinds- between the two cats. 

He has No Problem with my dogs. They came as puppies and he was older than then so they get along great. My toddler is very respectful with him and only here half the week anyways.

He is an ultra pampered cat. He is lean, he is very healthy. He is five years old. He did not have this problem the first three years of his life.

The pukes are, I finally admit, very specifically timed. They happen within an hour of him being told ""no"" to something or restricted from something (i.e; the food on my plate)- unless I catch him and grab him, then he puts off puking until he can find a solitary spot to do it.

We had a big move recently. That is relevant. This was FOR HIM. I had a large two bedroom apartment. I worried he was spite puking there because he didn't have space. Two months prior to the move I actually solved the spite puking/pissing (the pissing is a problem too actually but I want to focus on the puking since I only fully solved the puking at that time) by locking him in a small closet overnight. I don't know why that did it, but he wouldn't puke in that closet  so I'd feed him in there and he wouldn't puke and when I let him out in the morning so much time had passed that he couldn't force himself to puke anymore (though I had seen him trying). I thought I had solved the spite pissing too BUT I did find a little ceramic tile behind my washer he had been pissing on so I was wrong.

Now we have a three level plus basement semi attached townhome. It's gorgeous. Completely new. Costs me another thousand in rent. There's a lot of space, a lot of windows, and a balcony. 

The first two days, no pukes. The last two days, he's thrown up right on the stairs and right on the couch. I woke up this morning and caught him pissing on my suitcase. Then found out he'd been pissing on some clothes on the floor. The clothes- fine, he hates mess, he pisses on any clothes I leave on the floor. The suitcase perhaps was a mess problem too so I've cleaned up all mess (anything outside of a box was put back in the box lol I'll just unpack slower) so I am optimistic that will end, but I KNOW the puking won't. The puking was a problem for over a year before the move, barely stopped two months before the move, and now has picked up again. 

I'm going to try locking him in a small room at night again to eat so he can't puke, but it's a lot harder now that we have four stories of stairs to climb and he absolutely tries to escape me when I put him in a room. He can't be swayed by food. So this might not be sustainable, since I'm not exactly an Olympic level cat-catcher. 

I do not know what to do with him. I have tried everything reasonable I could think of. I have annoyed vets seeking a solution. I increased my rent to an insane amount to help this motherfucker. But he still spite pukes when I won't, say, let him eat a corn chip out of my mouth or if I have to move him because he's going to trip me going up the stairs. How *dare* I pick him up without permission.

I'm hoping, I guess, for a miracle. Perhaps someone has some similar problem and a really crazy but manageable solution.  I need creative advice, things the internet and a vet would be unlikely to think of. 

I accept this may not be possible, but I'm willing to try absolutely anything before giving up on this cat and accepting he may be better off in a farm where his spite puking isn't ruining anyone's lives (I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't have cat puke festering and hiding everywhere and costing me tens of thousands in damage in ruined floorboard, replacing couches almost every damn month because I am wearing them thin cleaning the puke, replacing mattresses, blankets, carpets, etc).

We've tried just about everything that friends, family and vets have recommended so are turning to the kind folks of the internet in hope of getting some suggestions.

So far we've tried the following:

1. Bought her every size/shape of scratcher imaginable. Tall sisal scratchers, horizontal and vertical cardboard scratchers, rope covered scratchers, sisal rug...
   1. The only ones she seems to use are the horizontal cardboard scratcher and sisal rug, and she doesn't use them very frequently.
   2. The only type we haven't bought are carpet-covered scratchers, but this seems like playing with fire as our apartment is carpeted.
2. Used catnip, treats, play/praise to encourage her to interact with the scratchers
3. Placed scratchers in various places, near where she naps, out in the open, near entryways, etc.
4. Covered every furniture in sticky paws tape or saran wrap...right now the apartment looks a bit like a scene from Dexter
   1. She will find the one, tiny, uncovered piece of couch and go after it - it's honestly kind of impressive.
   2. As soon as the tape comes off, Panda goes right back to her ways.

Our apartment is very quiet, and has lots of secluded spots for her to hide so I can't think of any source of stress that might be causing this. We have no other pets, and her health seems to be good per the last vet checkup.

matthewlachlan,1627107961,oqkk08,4,False,1,"Hi, I just wanted to share our story just because I've been looking at lots of posts about this and wanted to add to the advice. 
We have two cats. Wally (6) Quinn (3). Wally had a bad experience at the vet a couple of years ago and since then when he or quinn goes to the vet its a bit chaotic. However Quinn went for her routine check up and vax on Thursday and all hell broke loose in the house. 

The hissing escalated to growling and spitting toward both Quinn and myself and partner. We seperated them into upstairs downstairs quarters and Wally decided to cuddle with us again, but that first night we slept separately. Friday morning he was the same if not worse. He attacked myself and my partner and ran onto the balcony which we had to leave him out there for a bit but we weren't able to get even close to the window without him going at us. 

So after lots of panicking and anxiety and research this is what we did. 

We separated them Day 1 and tried to do some scent transfer but that really just pissed Wally off. D

Day 2. We kept them separated (Wally in Bedroom + Ensuite, and Quinn the rest of the house)- set up Wally with food/water/litter in the en suite bathroom, and purchased a Feliway diffuser for the bedroom. After a couple of hours Wally stopped hissing at us, but continued to hiss and Quinn if she came within his eye line when we tested opening the door a crack. We fed them at the bedroom door with the door open slightly but once wally had finished eating he would hiss again. 

We rubbed liquid from a tuna can on the backs of their necks which they licked off profusely. We also took a lot of time to rub Quinn in blankets from home to try and rub the house smell back onto her. 

Day 2 Evening we slept separately again, I slept with Wally and through the night he got up and used the litter, which he hadn't since day 1 and chowed down on the dry food.

Day 3 - Wally seemed to be more relaxed in the morning but we kept continued to keep them separate. We swapped out the blankets they slept on the night before. We fed them at the door again late morning, this time no hissing at all, but we weren't ready to open the door fully. late afternoon Quinn was resting on the couch (she'd spent most of the day sitting by the bedroom door). And we decided to open the door and see what happened. Wally came downstairs and they did some sniffing of each other and all was going okay, we fed them again just to do some positive reinforcement and as of a couple hours after that things seem to be still okay. 

It was a very stressful time and they way Wally was carrying I was scared it would never go back to normal, which is why I wanted to post this just to reassure anyone else going through the same thing that with patience and small-steps it will go back to normal. 

In regards to the Feliway diffuser, Im not sure if it actually worked or whether its just coincidence but they have both been very interested in sniffing at it, and wally was solely in the bedroom where we had it for that Day 2 period before he seemed to chill out.

It took a while to get him comfortable to go outside, but we finally did it. Only problem is he's still not too comfortable; cars and people scar him to death and he'll make a dash for either our front door or under the nearest parked car

To be honest, he just will generally aim to go under our car even if nothing is seemingly scaring him out there whenever he's not just chilling on our front door.

When he feels comfortable to explore, he will go to the front doors of our neighbors which can be really embarrassing especially if they open the door which will completely freak him out and have him make a beeline to our front door; to which I would give a quick and awkward greeting to my neighbors and go to the cat.

I understand why he finds comfort in both underneath cars and my neighbors front doors, since cars provide a safe little cave only accessible by him, and our neighbors' front doors are in such close proximity and rarely is anyone there.

But what ends up happening is I spend the whole outdoors session standing beside a car or carrying him from our neighbors' front door to our own only for him to go back there.

I should mention I have my cat on a harness and leash whenever we leave the house.

We have a park right infornt of our house and he has explored it once and seemed to really enjoy it; which was great for me because it meant I didnt have to awkwardly wait around our car or look like I'm snooping around our neighbors' house, as a matter of fact, I get to walk around the park which is nice.

Turns out it's apparently a terrible idea for some cats, cause I gave him a taste of the outside and now it's all he wants. Since then, all he does is meow and stand in front of the window. If he's finally silent and I open the door, he starts meowing and no toy or distraction stops him.

I've tried everything I've read in older threads:

* Enriching his environment: I bought a few plants for the balcony, and let him out whenever he wants to. Luckily he never jumps off, but he just goes back inside and keeps meowing. He's not very interested in the balcony despite the beautiful view. I also bought a big cat condo. He may climb on it and sit for a while, then go back to meowing. I bought a bigger, more expensive scratcher. He's touched it exactly once. 
* Distraction with play: I've always played a LOT with him. I recently bought a bunch of new toys.  My apartment looks like a cat daycare. As explained above, it's not effective cause it's never enough to distract him or tire him out.  
* Ignore him when he meows. He just keeps meowing tirelessly for hours. 
* Catnip: it does absolutely nothing.
* Feliway: nothing. It cost me $50.

When we first got him, he‚Äôd meow all night and walk on top of you while you‚Äôd try to sleep (it pissed my fianc√© off so much he actually wanted to sleep on the couch to get away from him) but after a week or so he adjusted to his new home. I‚Äôve had some mild behavior issues- mostly he was just ornery but I‚Äôve been told male cats can be that way. Nothing major. Now he‚Äôs just aggressive and destructive. 

In some ways, he‚Äôs still so sweet and loving, but I‚Äôm at the point where I can‚Äôt take it. He breaks things in the night by knocking off everything on my kitchen cabinets. I had to stop buying pop cans because he would knock them down and stab the cans with his claws and teeth and then push them around the floor, making my kitchen so, so sticky. He‚Äôs a smart cat and he‚Äôs discovered how to open a lot of things. He opens my dresser drawers and will climb inside and knock things out when I sleep. I have a bathroom attached to my room and the sink and cabinet is outside the bathroom door, and he will just go to the cabinet and open and close it over and over again. Nonstop. I‚Äôll call out his name and he‚Äôll stop for a moment before meowing and continuing again. It‚Äôs very loud and impossible to sleep through.  If I close him out of my room he just meows and claws on my door. He‚Äôs broken all my blinds and has started this habit of just scratching my walls. Not only is he damaging my apartment, but it‚Äôs the absolute worst sound, like nails on a chalkboard. He‚Äôs not allowed in the bathroom because he will just knock everything down and claw up my shower curtain. Yet, every time I go to use the bathroom, he zooms right in. If I manage to stop him, he will claw my carpet up and meow very loudly at the door. If he gets in, he destroys things. He recently destroyed one of my makeup palettes. I have a bag full of makeup in the main bathroom and he ran in, jumped on the counter and knocked it down. He also likes to knock anything on the counters to the floor and he likes to knock my kitchen trash can over (but only when it‚Äôs full). I can‚Äôt cook in peace because he will jump onto the counters or even the stove! Idk how, but he must have taught himself how to remove the lids off the pots and pans so I can‚Äôt even cover the food up. I realized this last night when I made soup and put the lid over the pan and a couple minutes later saw him on my stove and heard the sound of licking. Damn cat was eating the soup!He‚Äôs been destroying my furniture too. He claws my couch up, which I‚Äôm replacing my couch so I‚Äôm not too upset, but I still discourage it cause I don‚Äôt want him doing it to the new one. It makes me mad that he‚Äôs now doing it to my bed, which I cannot afford to replace. I tried spraying him with a water bottle. Sometimes he‚Äôll move, but other times (especially if he‚Äôs trying to get our food) he‚Äôll just sit there and let himself be sprayed.

My biggest issue though is how jealous he is and how he‚Äôs started attacking my dog. I have a chihuahua (Noey F12y/o), and in her former home she was around a cat and just didn‚Äôt interact with it. She was the one who seemed jealous of Salem at first, running over whenever I called his name or trying to hog all the attention when they joined me on the couch. At some points, Salem would try to play with her. He‚Äôd bat at her or lightly bite. Sometimes she‚Äôd ignore him, other times she‚Äôd do a low growl and he‚Äôd back off. Now, he‚Äôs just being mean to her. He chases her around the house and when she hides, he‚Äôll stick his paw under the couch and swat at her, or mess with her when she‚Äôs in her kennel, which really makes me mad since that‚Äôs her safe space where she goes when she wants to be alone (Salem has a carrier of his own where he goes to relax). It‚Äôs gotten to the point where if I pet Noey near Salem, he‚Äôll start swatting at her aggressively and will bite her really hard. I usually will make a loud noise and push him off her but my dog is now living in fear around him. If he comes within a few feet of her she‚Äôll snarl and growl and bark (which is especially frustrating at night) and when she‚Äôs sleeping in my bed with me, he‚Äôll run in, jump on her under the blanket or try clawing and kicking at her (he‚Äôll lay on his side, stick his claws in, and kick with his back legs) and when I sit up or say his name, he‚Äôll run off only to come back and do the same thing. 

He bites me and scratches me up whenever I push him away from things like the blinds. I‚Äôm not aggressive, but I‚Äôm not going to let him continue to destroy my apartment, so I‚Äôll slide him off the bed or chair he‚Äôs on to be able to reach the blinds. Sometimes he just bites and scratches for no reason. I was laying in bed texting my fianc√© about how I have no clue what to do with this cat and Salem wrapped himself around my arm and bit and stuck his claws in me. 

I don‚Äôt want to give this cat up. He‚Äôs been moved from shelter to shelter and my niece really loves him. He‚Äôs never intentionally hurt her (Altho she‚Äôs been scratched by accident while playing with him- she was waving some of his yarn in front of him for him to bat at and he nicked her hand) and he is really gentle with her. She can just carry him around the house or have him do the kitty dance (she‚Äôll move his two front paws to make him ‚Äúdance‚Äù) and he just sits there. If his aggressive behavior showed up after interactions with her, I‚Äôd assume maybe he was annoyed and didn‚Äôt like it, but there‚Äôs no correlation between it. I also keep my eyes out for signs that he‚Äôs angry or annoyed like his ears going back and I‚Äôve informed my niece of these so we know when he just wants some space.  I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs acting out because he‚Äôs bored. I‚Äôve bought him probably 20+ toys though and he has a scratching post and high places he can climb up to (I don‚Äôt have the space or money to get him the cat tree I really want to get him, but I let him climb on top of some high empty cabinets in my room since I know cats like to be in tall places) 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do with him. Like I said, he‚Äôs a sweetheart sometimes. I think he‚Äôs adorable. When I come home if I don‚Äôt pick him up, he‚Äôll actually jump into my arms (or more like just jump in front of me and I catch him lol) and he‚Äôs very cuddly and sweet and can be very affectionate. He‚Äôs also the only cat I know that likes his tummy rubbed. He‚Äôll just purr and will even stick his head up to lick my hand. At night, when he‚Äôs in bed with me and not being a jerk, he‚Äôll lay next to my head and I‚Äôll have my hand on him petting him and he‚Äôll rest a paw on my face in return, like he‚Äôs petting me back (which I think is very sweet). 

I love this cat, and I‚Äôm unsure if this past week has just been especially hard or if he‚Äôs getting worse. My niece has been really sick the past four days so I‚Äôve been sleeping in 1-2 hour intervals since at night she wakes up and cries from her tummy ache or is puking in the bathroom. I‚Äôve been especially frustrated because during these few hours of sleep I get throughout the day and night, Salem has been especially destructive. I had finally fallen asleep again after my niece woke up at 3 to puke and didn‚Äôt fall back asleep till after 4. It was around five and I was in bed exhausted and just as I started drifting away, I heard a loud crash and the sound of glass breaking. I got up and Salem was just sitting on a chair in the kitchen meowing after destroying some of my nice glasses. I‚Äôm sleep deprived and it doesn‚Äôt help that my only chances to sleep are filled with the shrieks of my dog when he attacks her, loud meowing, scratching, and just the damn opening and closing of wooden cabinets. Also, not as bad, but annoying. Salem likes to poop in his litter box and then knock it out and toss it across the living room floor. Pretty gross when every day I find another turd covered in litter next to my couch. Also, after refilling his litter, at least half of it will be on the floor next to the box since he just forms a giant pile there that I have to constantly vacuum up. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do with this cat. How do I train him if I‚Äôve already tried spraying with water and making noises. I‚Äôve put him in his carrier once cause I was doing a college exam during last semester and he kept knocking my laptop charger out of the wall and knocking stuff over that I had to constantly grab. Cause it was timed and recorded, I just grabbed Salem and put him in his carrier until I was done, but oh like I said, this cat is smart and he will squirm out of this carrier from the inside either through the Velcro top or by somehow finding a way to unzip just the tiniest bit in the side door and squirming his way through there. I don‚Äôt got a spare room to place him in that he won‚Äôt destroy things in. I just need some tips on how to train this cat to not be an ass.",CatTraining,Help!

My mother takes him outside since he's a little kitten and sits with him for hours and after coming back home, he sleeps and it goes on and on. Nothing abnormal like it had been. One day my mother decided to take him outside with his leash without my permission because i only put him on a leash just to take him on our balcony and let him see the sun, birds, to simulate outside but in a safer way in my opinion. After he go outside with leash to our apartment's garden with my mother, he went crazy about it and he started a behaviour that doesn't let me and others sleep in the night. Constantly meowing.

He NEVER stops until 6 in the morning and after he's done he decides to sleep in the morning and wake up late and sometimes he meows in the morning time. One day i even tried to not letting him sleep in the morning, constantly played with him, distracted him for like 6-7 hours and nothing changed he just took a quick two hour nap and started meowing at night like what i did to him is nothing. He even escaped from house for 3 days and after i found him he started again the day i found him again and took him back home. Last night i took him in his box and put the box outside of the window (window has bars, it is safe.) he decided to stop meowing ONLY i stay with him and i slept with him on window after some time i took him back inside and he just went to sleep.

What i started to do is i started to ignore him and told my parents to do so (it is very hard to ignore his meows bc it sometimes become very loud even i put on my headphones), i switched to planned feeding from free feeding (he's on his second day on planned feeding, nothing changed in his energy levels), i started to constantly play with him before feeding him and my sleeping time, i talked with my vet about this behaviour, he wanted a video about meowings then told me that he wants to go outside and he suggested me a pill which used in curing wrong pet behaviours (pill is called Kot Bayoun i found nothing in English bc i live in a foreign country and it has no chemicals only natural things) and i will buy it in the next week.

Cats does not have logic. Cats do not have a ""theory of mind,"" i.e. do not understand that they are cats, or even living beings. 

Everything they do is based on instinct or conditioning/training. That's it. Not logic or emotions that are any more than analogous to ours. Your cat likes being around you because you smell good and provide comfort and food. Maybe you remind them of their mom. 

But you are not their friend. 

Cats don't have a concept of friendship. People are beings that make them feel good, beings that makes them feel bad, or beings that can be ignored. Oh, and they might think of parts of your body as toys or prey.

We have learned and evolved to live alongside each other without killing each other. That's it. We did not create them in our image like we did with dogs.

This is a good fact to begin with when problem-solving. Don't think like a person. Don't even think like a cat, because they barely think in the first place.

Behaviorists: start by reading a matter-of-fact book that explains in ordinary terms how cats work, what they need, and operant conditioning. I can't find my favorite one and therefore can't recommend it, but I bet anything from the first page of an Amazon search would do the trick.

Only *then* read Jackson Galaxy. As far as I can tell he isn't wrong about the science or anything else, but his presentation is not anything close to matter-of-fact and his ideas make more sense in context. And note that a lot of his advice is for himself - nobody is going to feed their cats raw food four times a day at the exact time.

The love of my life is an adorable and chubby tabby kitten that I got from a rescue. She is exceedingly playful and social and has no social anxiety around new visitors or anything of the sort. I adore her, however, she is incredibly, incredibly naughty. Every day, around 40 to 50 times, she jumps on the kitchen counter, topples entire lamps and bookcases and smashes all of my glasses by knocking them over. I have tried all means of discipline, spraying her with water, duct tape on the counters, citrus, clapping - literally nothing works. I play with her for about thirty minutes to forty a day, and I live in a two bedroom apartment in which is next to a train station, and I was instructed by her foster mum to never take her outside without a leash. I do take her out with the leash but she kicks up and fuss and lays on her back and doesn‚Äôt move. As I am in lockdown she is driving me absolutely insane, she is so relentlessly attention seeking that it‚Äôs impossible to work or keep my heart rate at a normal level with her around. Does anyone have any tips on how to keep her at the very least off the counter? I‚Äôm worried she is going to get burned as I am cooking something. Is it just my cats personality?

Here‚Äôs how our day goes: sometimes he sleeps with me but I also have a 10 year old dog (she‚Äôs very gentle and just leaves him alone). In the morning I wake up to him antagonizing her (jumps on her face, bites her paws, chases her tail, swats at her). She just makes a grunt noise and then moves herself but he follows so I usually just shut him out of the room. He gets breakfast at the same time every morning and then runs around the house for an hour. I go to work. When I come home for lunch he‚Äôs sleeping like an angel but then wakes up and starts clawing EVERYTHING and messing with the dog. I go back to work. I get home for the evening and again, he‚Äôs sleeping like an angel. Wakes up, starts his episode of being insane.

He constantly chews on and claws at our rug, he tries to climb up the curtains, he chews on the cords to the blinds, he runs around nonstop (zoomies), he jumps at the dogs, he jumps at me and my roommates, he hides under blankets and jumps out from under them, scratching our feet in the process, he sees something make one little move and he goes after it, he jumps and claws at stuff hanging on the walls, jumps at our string lights (even thought he can‚Äôt reach them), he puts his paws up on the tv (I‚Äôm so scared he‚Äôs going to knock it over and get hurt).

I know it sounds like just cat things but it is extremely excessive. When I say it‚Äôs constant, I mean it‚Äôs literally constant. I‚Äôve never come home to anything destroyed which makes me wonder if he‚Äôs only acting like this when we‚Äôre home.  He gets dinner around the same time every night with the dogs. When he‚Äôs done eating he sits where he can get to their food as soon as someone isn‚Äôt looking so I have to stand there and watch. He doesn‚Äôt usually care and will still go for it knowing that I‚Äôm right there to stop him. He goes CRAZY in his litter box and kicks out half the litter every few days while playing. After dinner he sometimes calms down but lately he hasn‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I have to shut him out of the room to get sleep and so he leaves the dog alone. He proceeds to have his episode in the living room. I can hear it.

Lavenderhalfcandle,1626564005,omf03d,4,False,1,"So I've had a new stray I took in for about a month now, and shes great with people, okay-ish with dogs and just bad with the other cat (13 M) that was already here. I keep her in my room for the most part and occassionally let her out while I watch her with a spray bottle to make sure she acts alright. My main issues are:

-She is territorial over my room, guarding it from the older cat as well as the dogs sometimes (she'll chase the cat away while the dogs she'll kinda just block them and meow, like asking them to leave).

-If the other cat gets too close to her in the hallway or something, she will straight up start a fight with him, cat screeching and all. Her first real face to face encounter with him was when he snuck by everyone and managed to start snacking on her food, at which point the girl got very upset and chased him down. Could this have ruined the whole relationship moving forward?

The older cat will occasionally hiss and growl, but for the most part he is definitely more timid than her and will run away, which I feel encourages her behavior but he's been sheltered his whole life and isnt a fighter, while she was outside for at least 2 or 3 months before I took her in (according to some lost pets posts about seeing her around the neighborhood).

When she is aggressive with the dogs (usually she likes them and runs on them), she usually goes after the smaller female instead of the larger male, so I feel like shes trying to dominate the household but I'm just kinda speculating. I don't want her to end up trying to fight the larger dog because if she does, he will definitely not shy away like the other animals and might seriously hurt her.

How should I go about trying to remedy this? Should I do a ""reset"" and keep her isolated for a while before trying to reintroduce her to everyone again?

catbro1004,1626528176,om465u,2,False,1,"Hello folks :) 

My brother has a kitten that he was given 2 months ago. I met her for the first time last night and i was SHOCKED at how tiny she still is. He was told that she was 7 weeks old when he received her, but there's no way this otherwise healthy cat is 4 months old now - she still looks like a small kitten, nearly at adoptable age from my foster/rescue. I believe that she was just barely a month old when he was given her. 

She has a lot of the normal behavioural issues that come with taking a kitten from mom too early, like playing way too hard, lacking social skills and stimulation, etc. But the most worrisome/curious thing is the food aggression. 

This kitten is the most strangely aggressive kitten when it comes to food. Their own food and yours. My brother mentioned this yesterday but i didn't really see what he meant because we left her alone when she was eating. This morning my brother is out, gone to work, and i'm eating a bagel with cream cheese on the couch. I absentmindedly offered her a tiny bit of cream cheese on the tip of my finger, and she went WILD. She went for it, licking it, but then started hissing and snarling while she was licking it off my finger. She never bit me, probably because i kept my finger really still and let her finish, and then distracted her a little in order to get my hand away in one piece, haha. Funnily enough, AFTER this incident is the only time i heard this kitten purr in the 12 hours i've been here. 

As i said, this kitten is still SO young. Definitely only about 3 months old, maybe 3.5. What can we do for her? How can we socialize this sweet girl so she has a long and happy life with my brother. 

Some other pertinent info- my brother lives alone, and works shift work, so often out of the house for 12 hours. He always has kibble available to the kitten. He has tried wet food and it hasn't been successful - kitten would grab the chunk of wet food and run under the couch with it to eat it. Other textures were the same. Scoop out of bowl and try to run away with it. He has a large labradoodle that is SUPER gentle and 100% the kitten's best friend, and who has his own food and is not able to get to the kittens (up high on a cat tree).

AuroraSkye333,1626501820,olyntf,0,False,1,"I've posted a couple times on different cat subs and have used the bits of advice I've gotten combined with advice from my vet.

Honestly I'm one step away from hiring a behavioralist.

I have 3 kittens:

Shadow, 16 weeks, male, tuxedo

Gotham, 14 weeks, male, black/white

Oliver, 14 weeks, male, orange tabby

Gotham and Oliver are brothers/littermates, got them from a lady that hand raised them (not sure if mother rejected them or if there was another reason).

Shadow was found under a deck with his sister (who was taken in by someone else, I would've taken both but the sister had been given away already)... He was very clearly too young, pretty sure he was about 4 weeks when we got him. 

We got Oliver and Gotham when they were about 6 weeks old to be playmates for shadow.

We did everything that we were told to do by the vet, kept them separate, everyone is vaccinated and healthy, we have toys galore (dear God so many toys), two large cat towers, three smaller cat step/scratch post, four litter boxes, several food stations... 

Gotham and Oliver have the second bedroom to themselves, with one of the large cat towers, a scratch post, bajillion cat toys, two litter boxes, and their food station. 

Shadow has the rest of the house with the other cat tower, posts, toys galore, two litter boxes, and a food station upstairs and downstairs... His main food station is downstairs but we have a tiny bowl of dry food and water in our bedroom (plus one of the litter boxes) for when we let the other two roam the house and put Shadow away.

Occasionally we put him in their room to try to scent swap when they're exploring the house. 

So far our method has been, let Gotham and Oliver out in the rest of the house for a couple hours each day with Shadow either in their room or ours, still separate.

We haven't been able to let them coexist due to Shadow. Overall he's a more energetic/aggressive play cat, we've gotten him to stop using his claws during play pretty much entirely however he bites. He does seem to be more aggressive with me than with my husband. 

If I stop him from doing something, like trying to redirect him to a toy instead of my computer monitor he will turn around and bite at my hand or grab and bite my leg. When he does get aggressive like these we've been working on putting him in the bathroom for a few min to calm down and it does seem to work for that moment but I'll usually get bit later on. 

My husband and I do the exact same routines with him, but he doesn't bite my husband like he does me, I'm not sure why. He does also get super affectionate with both of us when he's not in his aggressive/play mode and often cuddles next to me to sleep at night... So I don't think it's because he doesn't like me, I'm just wondering if there something I'm doing wrong or if it's like an alpha cat type response.


Aside from that, the more important issue.. is when we try to mingle them all together he pins the younger two.. more often then not it's Gotham that he goes after.. grabbing them in a bear hug and biting at their neck, not just the back of the neck either he bites near their throat which makes me worried that he thinks of them as prey instead of playmates. 

He fixates on them too, we can usually get his attention or focus away from them for a few seconds but never for more than a few seconds before he is back to focusing on them. If he hears the door open he will run upstairs to try to get to them, if I'm in the room with them with the door shut he will paw under the door and cry/meow... He only cry/meows if I'm in the room.

They tend to paw at each other under the door and they pass toys back and forth under the door... Like I've literally seen shadow bring a Mousie toy up and bat it under the door, like he's bringing them a toy... And we've had them in the cat carrier in the room with him and he'll check them out for a bit but doesn't go hyper focus crazy unless we let them out of the carrier. 

Part of me thinks it might be territorial, my vet thinks it is probably aggressive play, that Shadow wasn't taught proper boundaries and doesn't know how to play with them right, but the only problem I have with that is that it just seems much more aggressive than playing wrong... 

Gotham has gotten bigger to where he can almost give it back to him, he's able to wriggle away but shadow just chases him down, and Gotham will start meowing at him. 

There's never been any hissing, but the younger two will always start mewing after a few seconds of being pinned, shadow never makes a sound. 

Gotham seems to be more scared of him as well, which I'm wondering if that's why he seems to be the one getting picked on moreso than Oliver... Though shadow will go after Oliver is he can't get to Gotham. 

We separate them as fast as we can when this happens, usually it's when he runs in when the door is opened, though we have tried it intentionally a few times several different ways with the end result being the same.

The only thing is... We did the food thing awhile back and... That doesn't seem to be an issue.. we had everyone eating on opposite sides of the door... And when we had the door open with everyone eating it was fine, no one left their food dish... And when shadow was done eating he didn't immediately go after them, he actually waited until they left the food dish before going at them which makes me be like...huh? 

But ya... I'm at a loss... Like it would be one thing if they just avoided each other if they didn't care for each other but shadow having to basically hunt them down constantly when they're out is what is bothering me. 

They're all scheduled to be nuetered around Sept/Oct though my vet said there's no guarantee that would help with the situation. 

Both Gotham and Oliver are super snuggly gentle cuddle kittens, I feel bad for them having to be in the bedroom so much, not that it's a small room, it's pretty decently sized, but still.. part of the reason we let them have the room and shadow the rest of the house was due to having Shadow a month before them (so he was already established in the house) and also because we figured Gotham and Oliver even if they're in the room they're not exactly alone cause they have each other, whereas putting Shadow in the bedroom full time he would be alone. 

So yea, any input on this would be appreciated, we're more than willing to keep trying no matter how long it takes, just need to figure out how to stop shadow from the fixated play/hunt he seems to do with them.

Just as a quick background, me and my now 9 year old cat moved into an apartment almost a year ago (for good reasons that I won't get into). She has always been a 90% indoors cat, but she wanted to go out at least a little bit. 

So I tried taking my cat outside with a leash (no prior training at all) and to my great suprise, it went perfectly fine! She got used to the harness and ventured outside for a little bit on day 1!  


She was of course a *little* afraid of cars/bikes/people, but she seemed to be getting more and more confident the more we went on walks!  


After we had been outside, she was calm and content all the way until the next evening.   


It kept on going fine for about 1 week, but then things started to gradually get worse and I don't understand why!  


First off, she is less content with just one walk than she used to be.   
Now after we've been outside, she wants to go outside again after about 1-2 hours. She is very persistent about this, but in a passive manner. She sort of reluctantly stays awake for hours, waiting for an opportunity to ""tell"" me that she wants to go outside again. I never take her out for a walk more than once each evening, I want her to understand that she gets ONE fairly lengthy walk per evening and that she can't ask for another one later at night.   
I'm trying to set up a reasonable schedule, but she doesn't seem to understand. She isn't particularly bothersome or anything, but I don't want her to force herself to stay awake in hopes of getting another walk...

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, she is all of a sudden very skittish! All that confidence that was building up seems to just have vanished for no apparent reason! 

Now she gets scared by every person or vehicle, or even just the sound of my shoes if I take a too loud step. I try to calm her down and give her praise/treats but it doesn't work. I don't know what to do when she freaks out and just pulls at the leash at the sound of a car. I feel like every choice at that point is a bad one. Usually I end up slowly walking up to her and trying to calm her down or carry her away from the scary thing.

One of them has urinary tract issues and the vet recommended that I keep her on a grain free diet to avoid UTIs, which has worked great for the last couple of years. Well, recently my parents started living with me and they have 6 cats. One stays in her own room when she's home, because she hates other cats. One of which is an outdoor cat because he HATES being inside (he's a really good boi though, love him so much!) He hates the indoors militantly. So I have 4 of these cats that keep going in my bedroom, which is becoming a serious problem. My two children have been less comfortable hanging out in my room if I'm not around due to their space being invaded, and they'll hang out by the door looking upset if I happen to come by, which means one of the other cats is in there.

One in particular is the biggest offender, and the biggest fata-... you get the idea. He will plop down and eat their food until the bowl is empty, then move to the next one. Mind you, when I put the food down for mine, they're quite hungry and ready to eat. I'd love to sit in my room and dick around while watching TV so they can eat with some, I don't know, protection? Sadly, I cannot. Too much stuff to do around the house lately and not enough time to puppyguard my babies food which is a huge strain on my wallet already in addition to other monthly expenses. Well, with it being eaten by the other cats, I am having to buy twice as much as a result. I have made it very clear to these other cats that they do not belong in there. They will sprint full-tilt out of the room if I catch them in there. So you can imagine, I've tried a water sprayer, the longest ""PSSSSHT PSSSSSSHHHHHT GET!!"" I can even make with my boy-ish lungs, closing the door after them when they bolt out, everything. Among other things you can't discuss here that resemble a horizontally launched missile. I've made it as clear as possible and it's definitely understood that it is Cat 1 and Cat 2's safe room as well as my own, and unsafe for any others. And yet they still go in there, and drain the food, the water fountain when I'm not home (from full to empty in the 8-9 hours I am gone) and use Cat 1's litterbox, which is only in there because Cat 2 made her litterbox shy. As if it's their 1st priority vs the food bowls, water dishes, and litterboxes they all have to themselves that my cats don't use.

So, short of making the other 4 cats outdoor cats, what can I do to make them piss off and stop going in there? It would be nice to be able to leave the food dishes out while I'm at work. Please help. I am going crazy and can't afford to feed 4 other cats who have plenty of food available.

However, my male kitten (M) bites the other female (F) VERY hard when they‚Äôre playing. I‚Äôve taken care of kittens before and I realize it can be a little rough at times but I‚Äôve never felt the need to step in very often except for these two or more specifically M.

I've been noticing that my one cat, Spock, is a resource guarding bully to my other cat, Tiberius (Ty). Spock like to sleep in his bed which is near the water fountain and when ever Ty goes to drink water, Spock will jump up and push him out of the way and drink water first. Ty tries to appease him, licking his head, but Spock pushes him out of the way so Ty goes and sits off to the side to wait for Spock to be done before drinking.

If Ty tries to sleep in Spock's bed (which is a prime window viewing spot) Spock immediately comes up and kicks him out.

I have to be careful if I'm petting Ty, because Spock will come up and shove Ty out of the way to get the head scratches. I don't pet him when he does this. I ignore him. Petting time is over. 

They also fight over things sometimes. Usually sleeping spots. Spock usually wins these fights. 

But Ty bullies my small old dog. (he's \~150% of her size) and she's afraid of doorways as a result just in case he might be looming above her waiting to take a swipe. She is the most docile creature ever and won't fight back. She cowers when the cats look at her. She doesn't bark. She just waddles around minding her own business. 

I wonder if I should get more water fountains, but I have several water bowls around and it doesn't seem to matter where Ty drinks from, Spock pushes him out of the way. 

Food isn't an issue. They share food just fine. I feed them at a slight distance (few feet) and they both snarf down their food so quickly that they don't have time to fight at all.

They have nearly infinite sleeping spot choices, but lately Spock has been preferring the window seat, and Ty takes the cat tree. 

I have a feliway multi-cat diffuser which doesn't seem to help at all. I've sprayed both their bedding with the feliway spray to no effect. 

Ty is on Amitriptyline from the vet. (Neither have any medical issues. They get annual bloodwork, etc.) He was spraying in the closet before he started on that, so he was stressed. He's more relaxed now on the medication, but Spock is still bullying him.

So we've adopted a relatively sweet cat called Kenny, and we don't know about his past other than 
1. He's neutered 
2. His old owner died
3. He's about a year old 

Generally he clearly likes humans, he will jump on your lap, forcefully demand petting by shoving his head at you, and even runs to me when I call his name. In fact most of the time he's amazing, but he has some big problems

1. He hisses at us a lot, he doesn't like being passed by sometimes and has swiped out at us with claws for trying
2. You can't really touch him outside head pats. I wouldn't dare pick him up and even trying to remove a bug from his fur calmly led to him threatening us
3. When he's mad in general he doesn't hold back too much, he hits pretty hard and often with claws. He even bit through a professional grooming glove we bought 
4. Even the vets found his behaviour odd. He was lovely to them one time in the room, letting them check him over, but nasty the next time with no obvious trigger.

Our primary problem is the other cat we have. She's gentle and seems curious about him, but he does not like her. We tried introducing them properly a la Jackson Galaxy, but we can't get Kenny interested in meal times, he's really not treat or food motivated. Maybe we should withhold food from him more to get him more engaged and to stop grazing? 

Often times she's tried to play with him or just be near him. I've watched her just lying calmly as he passes and hisses at her. Sometimes things get heated with them, but most the time she just watches him as he hisses at her. Sometimes they can just ignore each other in the same space, but sometimes he's in a bad mood.

We've tried a few things so far. Firstly we let him have the downstairs living room while she stays with us, but he's starting darting out the room a lot. We've tried giving him space and even built a cat superhighway in the living room, but he's a terrible climber anyway.

Honestly I wonder if he was abused, the way he hides when I raise my arm too quickly is different to the other cat. I also wonder if he was removed from other cats too young, my older female cat is gentle and agile, he's clumsy and vicious.

One particular cat has become increasingly more comfortable around my house than the other cats, and tends to come inside my house despite my efforts to keep him out (my windows are open 24/7 because of the weather). Starting about 3 months ago, I've woken up to him sleeping on my desk in my room. I usually give him a couple scratches under the chin and then move him outdoors.

I thought maybe he's a ""homeless"" cat, so I got him checked for a microchip at the vet and he has none. I figured he doesn't have an owner. So I bought him a collar (with a tiny capsule) and placed a note inside his collar, with my contact details &amp; asking whether the cat had an owner (bear in mind, I've never fed this cat or even given him water). It's been 3 weeks with no respone from the collar. I'm starting to wonder whether I have some responsibility in taking care of this cat?

I've owned 2 cats previously, and although I never considered getting another cat, I've developed a sense of responsibility for him, and I'm wondering what the moral/responsible/sensible thing to do is?

I couldn't really find a good resource and some resources contradict each other, so I just wanted to ask here as well;

* My guy is a British Chinchilla, 10 weeks old; 
* loves to play, isn't aggressive in any way, *loves beef*, sleeps a lot and doesn't really bother anyone, seems to be very comfortable around the house;
* He doesn't like to be picked up, moves away when I pet him, is a bit of complainer;  


**What I'm doing**

* Playing with him with a feather/mouse toy on a rod 2-3 times a day, even up to hour sometimes;
* Introducing him to new people and places, which I know gets him stressed;
* Feeding him little balls of beef, which he only gets, if he comes to me when I gesture to him and let's me pick him up without complaining; *using a clicker when he comes and when I pick him up;*
* Have been advised to fuck around with him, touching his paws, nose, ears, face, belly etc. etc.
* Brushing him every second day, he doesn't seem to mind it too much;  


**Questions**

* I think, I'm being selfish, when I want him to enjoy petting/getting picked up/ sitting in a lap, should I just let him be his own cat? Is it even trainable for him to enjoy these things? or is it up to the nature after all;
* Should I do anything else or anything differently?

He's curious and adventurous pulls on the leash constantly, then gets sassy with me when I don't let him go into the neighbors' yards and I pick him up to redirect him, but he winds up trying to go back a couple of times, lol.

I've tried different treats outside, but he does not give a damn about them because he's so fixated on the outdoors, so I can't even reward him for good behaviour! He just ignores me and the treats completely and explores the surroundings. I'm a bit clueless on what to do next because I'm more scared that he's going to wiggle out of the harness and run away or get hit by a car whenever he pulls on the leash or doesn't let me pick him up.

They were mostly getting along up until about a month ago... there were some instances of resource guarding and chasing but it was mutual.  Then the younger cat needed to go to the vet. The older cat was extremely aggressive towards the younger cat when we got back and we had to separate them. It was ugly.  We are new cat owners and were totally unaware that that was a thing. Now we know. Anyway, I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. After a few days we decided we needed to do a full Jackson Galaxy reintroduction, as it seemed the vet had exaggerated and brought to light the earlier problems and made them exponentially worse. 

So my house is a weird house. There are very few enclosed spaces. But we have a nice and large entryway with windows and about 250 square feet. The cats have always liked that room. It's warm and sunny and has some good places to hide. So we used that as one space and the other cat had the run of the house. It wasn't ideal but it was all we had. We were swapping the cats back and forth in the enclosed space to scent swap. The older cat HATED the enclosed space. She would cry and panic anytime anyone came in that room. She was miserable. The younger cat actually improved in the enclosed space. She started eating better, being more social and calmer in general. I think she liked having her own space.

We went through all the steps of reintroduction. Blocking sight and smell, allowing sight and eventually allowing sight and smell. and giving food only on opposite sides of the door. They are weird and quirky cats, so it didn't feel quite as cut and dry as the videos made it seem, but they did seem to be improving.

We‚Äôve had Leo (male + neutered) since he was 6 weeks old (yes very young the people we got him off told us he was older) and he‚Äôs been an only cat since then he always played super rough with us and never took to any training we tried with him.

A bit of hissing when the first met but overall pretty good. But when they play Leo plays very rough with Nala and she tries to get away and hide or growl which doesn‚Äôt seem to stop Leo.

sagittariusoul,1624983385,oabjfe,12,False,1,"I adopted a 1 year old male cat about 2 weeks ago and have been working on introducing him to my resident cat, a 1 year old female. Both are DMH breeds. Male is 13 lbs (not fat, just a huge, long boy) and female is 8 lbs and very petite. Initially I was worried about the male being aggressive or hurting my female due to the size difference, but actually, it‚Äôs been the exact opposite. 

Millie (female) is turning out to be WAY more dominant than I expected, and she will not stop yowling, hissing, growling, and swatting at Milo. We did the slow introduction and kept them completely separate for about 4 whole days. They ate together behind a closed door morning and evening every day. Scent and site swapped without seeing each other, then progressed to feeding on either side of a blanket covered baby gate, then we took away the blanket. 

We‚Äôve gotten to a point where they can eat just fine in the same room together, even play with the same toy if they are taking turns (they still keep their distance when doing this though) and are generally fine when distracted with toys or food. 

However, when all other distractions end and my female cat focuses on him, she becomes absolutely feral and yowls/hisses and tries to stalk him in the space. He retreats immediately and she will chase him down if we don‚Äôt intervene. We typically try to stop their interaction before it gets to this point, but there have been a few times where Milo will run out of his ‚Äúbasecamp‚Äù room either in the bathroom or bedroom, and she has attacked him. No blood or major injury, but fur has flown, so I know she means business. 

I feel so discouraged. Milo is SO sweet and he just wants to enjoy his home and meet his sister without her attacking him. He makes friendly-sounding chirps at her when he sees her and even this sets her off. We have tried positive reinforcement with treats and even bought a pheromone diffuser, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be improving. 

It‚Äôs gotten to a point where she will sit and lure him to stick his paws under the door, only to yowl and attack them. I haven‚Äôt known peace in my house for the last two weeks, and I am tired.

I guess I'll preface with this never used to be a huge issue. My girlfriend and I moved in with another couple, some good friends of ours, about 2 years ago. They share a bedroom, my girlfriend and I have separate bedrooms. We all have our own cats.


We will call roommates' cat Jackson. They got him when they moved into their first apartment ~4 years ago. While living in their old apartment, they found out Jackson had urinary crystals, so he had a catheter put in. There would be the odd chance he would pee on a blanket or rug every now and then, but it was never super excessive- maybe once every 2 weeks or so. They cycle would continue once they were moved in with us, but if he did pee, it was always on their stuff and it never really affected us so we weren't bothered.


Throughout the time of all of us living together, he seems to have gotten worse. He is on a diet that consists of special foods to keep crystals from forming in his urine. He has a microchip feeder and is kind of free-fed. Gf and I's cats, we'll call them Joey and Onion, do not and are fed twice a day with controlled amounts in our respective rooms. Sometimes though, they will have small amounts of leftovers and Jackson will take it upon himself to eat their food. It seems like he prefers their food to his because his feeder is usually pretty full. It can be hard to monitor all of their eating habits at times since none of us are ever really home until 5pm at earliest, but most of the time, 8pm. Because he isn't eating his own food, he is forming crystals again and is peeing on things. Except this time he's pretty much exclusively peeing on my gf's stuff. Joey and Onion's food is always put away at night but it seems the small amounts Jackson takes throughout the day is enough to cause him issues. 


He's only ever peed in my room three times in the span of a year, but with gf, it has been damn near daily. It mostly happens when a shirt or other piece of clothing is left on the floor, but even if there isn't, he's gone as far as to jump on her desk chair to urinate, and even her bed. She doesn't want to keep her door closed because Joey loves to hang out in there, which is understandable since his food, water, and toys are also in there. I have the same reasons for my room being open for Onion. Whenever we catch Jackson trying to sneak any of Joey or Onion's food we will clap which is usually enough to startle him away, but now hes learned that when we clap we won't actually come at him, so now we usually have to physically pick him up and put him in a different room. He'll still persist after though.


We just don't know what to do at this point. We have 4 litterboxes in the house and all of them are kept relatively clean. Roommates have tried to keep Jackson isolated in their room which usually works but it seems like a bad solution for the long term. We all just went on a 3 day trip where he was let out of the bedroom and didn't urinate at all, but the night we came back, he peed on my gf's rug. Is there anything we can do to teach Jackson to stop urinating on the floor, specifically my girlfriend's stuff? Its caused her so much frustration and distress that she wants to move out, which we can't necessarily afford right now.

I have two cats. One is male and about 4 years old and the other is female about 2 years old. 

My partner and I have been dog sitting as a side gig for a couple years and have been doing pretty well with it. The cats don't seem to mind having dogs around and act almost exactly the same. The only thing that is different is that our male cat, probably for territorial purposes, pees on the floor next to his litterbox when we have dogs staying with us. The litter box (one of those electronic self scooping jobs) is inside of a repurposed closet and is very private. Dogs can't really disturb the cats while they are in there. About once per week, I have to empty the closet and deep clean the floor under the box. 

I have tried lining the closet with trash bags, putting rugs down, and even getting a different style of litterbox (tried with the hood and without the hood). Nothing seems to stop this little dude from peeing on the floor.

My partner and I moved to a new place about a month ago and my cat,Daphne, seemed to get acquainted with it fairly quickly.  A few days after our move, she fell off the kitchen table and since then began hissing/ growling/ attacking anything with her reflection.  Mirrors, tiles, shower door, picture frames - anything reflective.

We took her to the vet who said she was not injured from the fall and might just be anxiety. So we covered up the surfaces we could and bought her an anxiety collar, anxiety treats and drops, and a Feliway.  None of which have seemed to do anything.  In fact, we had to unplug the Feliway as she was starting to think there were other cats around even more. Positive reinforcement didn't work either...

I tried to begin desensitizing her to these surfaces and slowly introduce her to ones in the bathroom, and it got better for a bit, until it didn't.  I feel like I have exhausted my options here and my partner and I are very concerned.

Hello! 

To begin, both animals are fixed, and are domestic long hair with no defining breed. 

About two weeks ago we adopted a young kitten.

We did everything by the ""book"", so to speak. Pheromone defusers and spray. Separate rooms. Switching rooms.   Scent swapping... you name it.  

The only thing we haven't done is the feeding under the door. While we have done this in the past with the female and another cat (who passed away a few months ago)... Its been about 9 years since that and we moved houses. We set up kitty homebase in our downstairs office. Trying to get the senior female to change her feeding routine and move downstairs (usually she eats upstairs in the kitchen) was stressing her out. But we rewarded her with treats when she would come down and investigate the office door...

There was curiosity from Alpha Cat. So about 5 days later... we figured the baby gate introduction was okay... Nope. Ver since She's hissed and been hissing whenever she ""encounters"" him... this could be under the door. In his cat carrier... His kitty play pen. 

I have read ""let the older cat hiss to establish dominance"" to ""stop your cat hissing!!""  ... ""hold your kitten... don't hold your kitten"" So I am confused. 

Poor Lil guy just wants to explore all the space. I don't want all this hissing to  make him develop a complex. 

How can I ease this for both cats? I want to sleep in the same bed as my partner again! lol (since keeping the cats separated one of us sleeps in the room to make sure either cat has their routine of night time cuddle routine)",CatTraining,9 year old female cat keeps hissing at 2 mo male kitten

We‚Äôve reached the point in the introduction where the two cats can be out together, but where the senior really doesn‚Äôt like the kitten and is trying to avoid him, which we‚Äôve allowed and encouraged.

So far we‚Äôve kept downstairs and the bedrooms as a space where the senior is allowed to retreat if he feels harassed, and have tried to ensure the kitten is not allowed to go in these areas. The senior‚Äôs litter box is downstairs. Anyways, the kitten discovered downstairs a few days ago, and we‚Äôve continued to bring him upstairs whenever he goes downstairs.

However, the kitten doesn‚Äôt really want to explore downstairs so much as he is obsessed with the senior‚Äôs litter box.

sagittariusoul,1624457737,o6do80,2,False,1,"My boyfriend and I have been fostering-to-adopt a 1 year old male cat for the last week and a half. We already have a 1 year old female in the household, whom is relatively well behaved and only has a few minor behavioral issues (mainly chewing cables, which we have worked on a lot). 

We are discovering that our new cat however, is a bit more ornery than our female. He started out very sweet &amp; affectionate when we first got him, but as we are getting to know him, he‚Äôs gotten a lot more ‚Äúbitey‚Äù when we try to pick him up/move him or when he wants to play. He will attack our feet when sitting or even walking around. I‚Äôm thinking this may be because he‚Äôs bored &amp; wanting to play, but even with more playtime, he still exhibits these behaviors. 

He also has been messing with my plants, which my female cat has no interest in. I‚Äôve put up the smaller plants he seems to be interested in, but the bigger plants I can‚Äôt really move and he‚Äôs turned his attention to them. We watch him when he‚Äôs out in the living room (where most of the plants are) and try to redirect/discourage him from messing with them, but he still tries to mess with them. None of my plants are deadly toxic, but some may cause mouth irritation/GI upset, so I definitely don‚Äôt want him chewing on them. 

As far as introductions go‚Ä¶ we are still working on things. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be aggressive to our female cat at all- in fact, he chirps at her like he wants to play/be friendly with her. She is fine as long as he is distracted and not paying attention to her. We keep them separate unless we can supervise them, and they only see each other when eating on either side of a baby gate. We‚Äôve attempted Jackson Galaxy‚Äôs ‚Äúeat play love‚Äù method of shared playing, then feeding, but as soon as they stop being distracted with food or play, my female hisses and growls. Once or twice my female has actually run up to him and swatted him, but we quickly separated them &amp; no injuries were had. He now keeps his distance from her and doesn‚Äôt try to approach her first. 

It‚Äôs getting harder to keep them separate though, as he wants to be with us more and explore the rest of the house. Our female cat is used to spending most of her time with me, so I feel bad separating her for too long. I wish they would at the very least, just ignore each other in the same area! 

I‚Äôm really starting to become discouraged. We want to keep him, but as our foster period is coming to an end this Saturday, and we have to make the decision to either adopt or return him, I‚Äôm struggling with my confidence that we can improve this situation.

For the living situation is a bit complicated, but in the easiest terms the male stays upstairs in 2 rooms and the female is downstairs in 3 rooms.

To the problem:
He will stalk the female like shes prey and run at her and starts to chase her and attacks her. He has done this every single time we try to introduce them again. She runs and corners herself and won't fight back. It's not just smacking, I think he bites too. I don't think it's food jealously, and I don't think it's territorial because he's fine when they are being fed together.  

We have tried feliway, calming collars, calming treats, reintroducing numerous times.  They each have their own litter box and lots of cat trees and tall things to climb on. We play with them usually every day as well and they have plenty of toys too. I just am at my wits end. We will be moving soon to a house where we can't really separate them without one cat being locked away in a bedroom all the time and would really like them to at the least tolerate each other.

smokeishername,1624023476,o2pads,21,False,2,"**Background information**

My cat is a 12 year old neutered male. He was a random stray kitten that we found when he was several months old (probably the kitten of one of the numerous farm cats around here). For the first few years of his life he was just an outdoor cat that we fed and cared for, but when we moved to the city we took him with us and made him an indoor cat. He is *extremely* friendly and a vocal cat in general.

When we took him in and made him an indoor cat, we also had to switch to scheduled feeding times because he was getting really fat with grazing. This is when the issue started (meaning it's been going on for around 8-10 years, so I know it will take a lot of patience to break.)

**Current issue**

I have recently begun training my cat to stop meowing for his meals (clicker training, he already knew how to sit on command), and it's been working decently well. I've been doing it for a week. He used to run around completely out of control meowing at the top of his lungs, jumping up and down from the counter, etc. I've been making him sit quietly for increasing lengths of time before I will feed him (he's up to about 3 seconds now), and I'm feeding in small bits instead of all at once so he has to practice several times per meal. I also started doing it with treats in the middle of the day. It's really worked well and now he meows more quietly, isn't running around, and isn't jumping on things. I plan to continue this until he just sits patiently for food the whole time I'm dishing it out.

I want to know if there is something additional I need to do to address his incessant howling while I'm in the shower. (For reference, every morning my alarm goes off, I take a shower, then I feed him.) He meows *the entire time* I'm in the shower literally *as loud as he can*.

Will continuing the current training regimen start to produce results for this part of the morning too, or should I be doing something additional to address the shower-time meowing? I was anticipating that making him sit patiently would more-or-less calm him down about meal time in general, and this would gradually work its way back until the point that he doesn't meow during the shower, either, but I am not sure.",CatTraining,How to get cat to stop meowing while I'm in the shower

AlexandraMariaIlona,1623906683,o1p6af,14,False,5,"Ok so for some background here: We have a 15 year old male cat. His older brother passed away last year. We decided to get a new kitten, after consulting our vet to see if it would be ok. The vet vaccinated our cat, and declared him healthy enough to have another kitten in the house. The vet advised us to get two, but we were worried smokey (15 y/o male) would be hostile to the kittens, and decided to try one figuring that if we had to return it to the adoption agency it would be better to return one than two. So we picked up an 8 week old kitten and brought him home and put him in a separate room. We followed the Jackson Galaxy introduction method for the two. However, we‚Äôve been having some issues with Smokey‚Äôs behaviour since we‚Äôve brought the new kitten home. He‚Äôs absolutely terrified of the kitten, and is constantly watching the door where the cat is. He‚Äôs also extremely angry with us, and while he was formerly very affectionate now won‚Äôt let us touch him at all. When we do pet him he‚Äôs stopped purring. I‚Äôve also noticed a decrease in grooming. He‚Äôs not having any issues with eating, drinking, or using his box. In fact food and going outside are the two things that seem to make him happy. My parents thought maybe he needed to see the kitten, and after a fairly uneventful introduction through a carrier let the kitten have a supervised visit with Smokey. We were able to get the kitten to play with some string and Smokey to play with his treat ball about 5 ft apart, but Tiber approached Smokey and Smokey sprinted down the stairs. Again there was no hissing or fighting, Smokey just seems terrified. I also have since realized through research that we made a major mistake by moving smokey‚Äôs food, water, and box out of our spare room so we could isolate the kitten, but the bathroom seemed unfair to the kitten. We‚Äôre going to try the Feliway stuff, but I have some concerns because online guides say you have to start using it before the kitten arrives. Will this help at all? Is there anything else we can do to salvage this relationship? We went into this wanting to try a kitten out, but want to do anything we can to try and keep it.

Currently I've got a order for a harness and backpack to come in the mail. After moving to my current place about a month or so ago, my cat loves the outside. When I got her I lived with other people and she was restricted to smaller rooms. Now she loves to be outside and is generally well behaved. When I go inside (without a leash this is all happening) then she follows, if I call for her in one direction she's generally good with going the direction I want unless see she's something. Her focus is lost now and it's hard to get back.  


Sometimes though she may chase a butterfly under a car and at that moment, I squirt her with a squirt gun (used to be a water bottle). Sadly because I was stupid before, I did this when she did something bad so instead of teaching her that the behavior is bad, I taught her water is bad. When she see's the bottle or gun, she flinches and I don't want that. I don't know if I'm being too soft or not as no one teaches this to you.

padawanbabe420,1623555554,nynwf3,17,False,1,"I would first like to start this forum off with how much I actually love this little asshole that has came into our lives. I do not, will not, or will ever consider getting rid of him. This is purely me just being cat-ignorant and seeing if anyone has experienced similar situations, and how they dealt with it. 

We recently rescued a kitten back in March 2020. I was working from home, and my boyfriend was home most of the time due to hours being cut. Safe to say, we were home a LOT tending to this baby kitty. A friend of ours found him in the middle of the road during a storm and we took him in. He was starving, sick, had all kinds of infections, but obviously we got him straightened right up at the vet and he was soon a happy, healthy kitten.

As he grew, nothing seemed abnormal whatsoever. He was playful, curious, and very affectionate. Did we spoil him? Yes. Did he spend nearly every second of his life on my lap or in my presence while I sat at my home office? Yes. Did we give him constant attention? Yes. We have only had a dog (as adults) and we were very excited to incorporate a new member to our family. He gets along with our dog very well too so we just treat them like our children because we dont have any. 

During his cat ""teenage"" years, he developed a biting habit. I understand this is partially our fault since we interacted with him in such a playful way with our hands so often. We noticed the issue and invested in dozens of various stimulating cat toys and a cat tower. He wanted nothing to do with them despite our efforts introducing him. We later also experienced minor behavior issues, such as scratching furniture, being glutinous, trying to climb walls, you know (normal cat things?). We also purchased a townhome and moved in around June, so we figured he was just adapting to a new environment and probably having a bit anxiety. 

September 2020 came around, and it was time for me to return to the office, and my boyfriend had just 
also started his own business. So needless to say, we went from being home constantly, to being gone for the majority of the day. We got him neutered shortly after this time hoping we would see him calm down a bit, but honestly it got worse.


This is where hell broke loose.


He is now a little over a year old, and he is a cat nightmare. 


Despite his still very affectionate and playful personality, every other characteristic of this cat is pure, 100% BRAT. He is constantly knocking down anything he can find on the counter to get attention. I have probably went through 10 yankee candles he has knocked down in various areas of the house. Glasses of water have been the worst. He later became so strong that he could knock down a 5lb bottle of laundry detergent, house decorations, phones, and have I mentioned expensive candles?
 We have adapted our house to be cat proof at this point but he still manages to find anything in his path to destroy. He is also very glutinous. He sneaks into our pantry and will eat until he cant anymore. He has gotten into bags left on the counter, and wont stay out of the kitchen and counters when I'm cooking. And he bites. Hard. To the point where I am scarred from head to toe from his teeth. He never uses claws though, I noticed. I walk up the stairs in pure terror because he jumps out of nowhere to latch onto my legs and ""ride"" it upstairs. We have tried clapping, making loud noises, and even had to resort to a spray bottle to try to stop this behavior, but he likes water so, that didnt help. He just got excited and ran around even more.

Every morning is terror. We get up pretty early to feed him around 6am every day, but the attention demanding personality of this cat will not let us sleep past 5am. Even after we feed him, unless we have play time or pet time he will continue doing this until we leave for work. He begins knocking down the last few objects we have placed on our room that just have to be there (phones, books, bluetooth speakers). They make loud noises when impacted on our hardwood floors and I think he just believes it will get us out of bed. 

My poor dog has also experienced trauma. This cat treats him like his big brother and play-attacks him through every corner. Fortunately he is very patient and allows it and even plays back, but eventually he gets tired of it and has to endure it until inevitably he goes to sleep, if we are lucky, a few hours.

I have also recently started taking him outside with me on a leash to see if that would help, giving him extra attention and stimulation. Unfortunately we are not in a postion where we can let him roam freely because we have a deep and rapid creek in the backyard, and not only the dangers of that could cause him harm but there are also snakes and other animals that could hurt him. So a supervised leash trip will have to just be enough. Ever since I brought him outside, he has became a door dasher, which terrifies me because the last thing we want is for him to run away. I have spent some time training him , going inside and outside and giving him a treat when he goes inside by himself. This hasn't seemed to help.

Last but not least, he is increadly vocal, which is cute and I believe I caused this by speaking to him in cat meows his entire life, and singing to him in high pitched noises. He also spends the majority of the night yowling out the window, and strangely enough it gets worse when it is a full moon. It sounds more like howling at that point.

If you have made it to the end of this thread, and can provide any advice or knowledge that would help stop any of these issues, please comment below. I know it seems exaggerated and just ""normal cat things"", but I believe this cat is truly a spoiled ass brat creation of our own doing. I do understand that we probably babied him too much and that is why he is this way. I just need to know how to fix it.

A little background. First time cat owner (previous dog owner). I first picked up my first cat this year. After a few weeks we fell in love her and felt the need to get a second cat (two is better than one, yes?).  After some quarantine/home base period the kittens started getting along and eating together. 

Issue: My one cat (Peanut) will signal she is done with her food by attempting to bury her food. She will walk around, while my other cat (Pepper) will stop eating out of her bowl and start eating out of Peanut‚Äôs bowl. Peanut will than casually walk over to Pepper‚Äôs bowl and start eating from it. I realize I can also continue to spoon feed her the food she left from her own bowl. 

Their current feeding patterns are wet food in the morning, training with dry food and treats for snacks in between breakfast and lunch (10-15 minutes of me tossing snacks and clicker), leave dry food for between 12-5 (sharing the same dish, sometimes at the same time. Wet food for dinner. 

A few things to note is that the do share the same water fountain, and milk dish when it is provided. Also when I leave the ‚Äúgrazing food‚Äù I will either see them nibble on it one at the time. One cat will wake up earlier than the other sometimes.

This desperate cat owner is ISO stories of hope, as a quick search through this sub is mostly turning up similar stories of frustration with no positive outcome.

My 10 year-old neutered female American longhair LOVES leash walking... so much that she very loudly howls and scratches at the front door for upwards of 12 hours per day. My husband and I work from home, and it's **very** difficult to focus / handle frequent zoom meetings, let alone sleep through the night. Our stress levels are through the roof, and we even saw a cat behaviourist a few weeks ago who recommended a list of things, most of which are not working:

* Walking her on a strict schedule (we do this every day at 5pm for 40 minutes)
* Ignoring her when she howls (we have been very consistent with this for \~3 weeks, and it has only made her howling more intense)
* More play at home (she rarely engages ‚Äî¬†she will be interested for 1-2 minutes then leave my side to resume howling at the front door)
* Sedatives (cat CBD is the only thing keeping my sanity intact; it helps somewhat, but she needs frequent dosing, and it's expensive)
* Feliway / calming pheromones (no effect)

This is not the first time we have tried adding leash walking to her life, with similar effects. We have tried stopping all outside access at various times in the past and this will eventually calm down her behaviour, but my dear husband is very determined to give her a full, enriched life with regular outdoor access and will not accept ""no outside access"" as a solution. So far, my experience of her has been that more outside = more howling.

We have ordered supplies to outfit our 6th floor urban apartment balcony into a protected ""catio,"" but the balcony is right next to my work desk and I'm really concerned that she will begin howling at this door non-stop to go in/out once we give her the option.

We have also taken her to a vet recently, who ruled out any health problems that could be causing this.

Two cats. Both male (appx 7 and 6). Both fixed. We‚Äôve had the 7 year old for 4 years and the 6 year old for 2. The 7 year old was definitely a stray before we got him (ear is clipped as part of a catch and release program). The 6 year old we‚Äôre unsure but unlikely.

We‚Äôve had to keep them separate for two years now as the older cat is pretty aggressive and they‚Äôve got into a couple of fights with hissing when I let my guard down. We‚Äôve done this by letting one have free reign of the main room in our old apartment while the other was put up and would swap them out. What I don‚Äôt understand is that he‚Äôs not always aggressive so I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it is that might actually be the trigger? And what steps I can take to make them more tolerant of each other. They don‚Äôt have to be best friends but I want them to both be comfortable with each other to live fairly peacefully together.

For instance, yesterday I had the older cat on a harness and leash in the house (we just recently moved in) so that they can both free roam but that I can keep him in check in case he decides to go after the other. For the most part, they both just walked around, sniffing, exploring the new place, and ignoring each other. We walked upstairs and I sat down, the older cat near me and the younger one about 3 feet away. They both laid down and would slow blink at each other and the older cat would even roll over on his side exposing his stomach, two things that I thought were non-aggressive signals. As soon as the other cat would move to go to a different spot (would have to walk past him) the older cat would suddenly sit up, bushy tailed, and act like he was going to attack (pulling on the leash trying to get to him). No hisses or growls. I wish I‚Äôd paid more attention to his ears as I can‚Äôt recall if they were flat but I don‚Äôt believe so. But it kept the younger cat from walking past him and they did this a couple of times until we went back downstairs.

I‚Äôm sure part of it is territory related. We lived in a small apartment previously and just moved to the new house.

If I let him out, he'll come back asking to be let back in in a few hours and by then I'm in deep sleep. So because opening the door for him or leaving the door open isn't an option, I have never actually given in to his night time meows. I was hoping after a few week he would learn that meowing only works during the day but hes been persisting for a few weeks now and hasn't stopped trying. Probably because he knows I can hear him and its so effective during the day.   
When he meows at night I don't react in any way because I feel like it would only reinforce it. So so far I've just been completely ignoring it. Its a pain but after 5-10 minutes he'll eventually give up so its a short term solution. This might sound silly but I've also tried holding eye contact with him so he knows I heard his request and I'm not budging, it stops him from meowing because he has my attention but usually just lengthens the whole process before he gives up.

one of my 8 rescued cats is driving me nuts, he was found in a roof of a building, was taken by someone and I suspect they didn't treat him nicely, we took him over to us and now he had been with us for over a year, he runs around the house and keeps checking the windows outside, I tried taking him out a few times but he seems afraid.
He never properly peed or pooped inside cat toilets, he usually poops in the bathtub and often he pees and sprays around corners of where I stay at, I.e our bedroom (few corners) next to my pc in my work room and other places that make me think it has something to do with me, but I don't know what.
it's driving me nuts, one of the times he sprayd on my pc and one of my ports now doesn't work, the pc itself constantly smells like pee and I cannot get the smell out, please help.

For context
we have 8 cats
3 of them including him are indoor and 5 are outdoor meaning they do their buissines and stay out a lot as they were used to it before we reduced them.
we have 3 litter boxes with one having cat litter while the other 2 don't as he isn't used to them. 
I just ordered pellets and will be trying to expand the litter boxes In hopes that he will go in one of those, problem is the spraying, he doesn't just pee, he usually sprays.",CatTraining,My cat sprays and pees in corners around the house
Rengyoku,1622871716,nsor5w,14,False,1,"My cat was neutered at 6 months. Now he is 10 months old. 

Since I adopted my cat when he was three months old we always played at least three times a day before the mealtime.

I saw how he loved to be in the patio and watch the birdies, so I leash trained him to go outside.

Everything went fine until we started going outside. At first he was overwhelmed and he was quiet sniffing everything, but after a week or so he really enjoys the experience, he goes with his tail up and we can walk further and further. We spend a lovely time together.

The problem is, the only thing he wants to do now is to go for a walk. We go for a walk at 7 pm everyday, but he will be all day begging to go out. He doesnt want to play with me anymore, we play a little and then he leaves and goes to the front door.

tillwehavefaces,1622861777,nsm2py,6,False,1,"So I have two cats. They have been with me for 8 months and are semi-bonded. They mostly get along normally. But the younger cat went to the vet and had a dental procedure. And now the older cat keeps attacking her. She is literally stalking her around the house and attacking her. Hissing, growling, chasing, physical confrontation - the works.  I know this is normal but how long does it last? We're going on 36 hours and they still can't be in the same room as each other!

Background: My two cats aren't normal cats. The older one is 5 and while she had one home all her life, I don't think it was happy. She is extremely timid and anxious. She's smart enough to know when we are trying to put her in the side room (separated) and she fights it. 

The younger cat was feral, and very under socialized. They have both made great strides here. but they are quirky and sometimes the equilibrium seems tenuous. For example, we are separating them right now but they HATE IT. They hate being trapped in any form. Whichever cat is in the separate room will just roam around in there for hours, never settling down and sleeping. (yes, there is food, their bed, water and litter.) Secondly the feral only lets us touch her sometimes and not when she is stressed. We tried wiping her down to get her normal scent back, but she is too stressed out to let us get too close.

throwRAedint,1622824518,ns9c6s,13,False,1,"Hi everyone!

I have a willful cat who used to free roam indoors/outdoors when I lived with my mom. Dexter just had to meow at a door and someone would open it. My mom very cutely started ""training"" him to yell ""ME-OWT!"" when he wanted to go outside, and I laughed but asked her to stop immediately. 

3 years ago I moved to a city apartment and Dexter is not happy, understandably. A year ago I moved to a quieter neighborhood and started doing leash/harness/stroller walks. This has lead to an explosion of bad behavior. 

For about 6 hours a day, everyday, spread out unpredictably, Dexter will HOWL at an exterior door (thanks mom). I was very good at ignoring him, until he found the one thing I cannot ignore: property damage. There are scratches and streaks in both my exterior doors, and the sound of his claws on paint is from another world of audio pain. 

My partner and I have built barriers, but he can either tunnel through them if they are lightweight, or stand atop them if they are heavy, and scratch the mid/top of the door. (We haven't tried those hiss canisters yet, near top of list.)

Taking him on walks makes it worse, apparently. As summer came around we've been doing 3 a day but the behavior only worsens. And the way he is shrieking and screeching, if I were a neighbor I would think he is being hurt. It's bad. 

He doesn't mind the watergun anymore so I don't use it. Ignoring him makes the property damage worse, you can't imagine what I woke up to today. 

So, what do you do when your cat found the one thing you can't ignore? 

I don't want this to be a sob story, but my partner is currently amicably breaking up with me, citing the cat chaos as a large reason. It's really impossible to live through, I hope that shows how bad it is and how much it is genuinely ruining my life. I would never get rid of Dexter but even I am starting to crave release from this home situation too. I work from home, and for several hours every day, mental work is functionally impossible, because noise and damage to prevent.

I just adopted a one-year-old tuxedo cat about three months ago. We have not had any bathroom mishaps until now.

Today, however, as I was getting ready for work she climbed onto my duvet and peed. I was shocked and immediately cleaned up. I also switched out her litter and cleaned her box (I typically switch out her clumping litter completely every 2-3 weeks and scoop daily). There was some poop in her box but not enough to make it undesirable to pee in. 

She is in great health. Playful, chatty, and sassy as ever‚Äîshe has no symptoms to make me this is something medical. However, she does hate when I leave for work. When she hears my keys, she starts meowing incessantly. 

I don‚Äôt know what my next step should be. I having been thinking about changing out her litter since it seems to stick to her paws and maybe switching to a simple tray litter box. Or maybe I should take her to the vet if this behavior continues? Unsure.

One of my two boys currently uses a microchipped feeder for wet food as he‚Äôs very slow at eating and the others would take his food so the chipped feeder solved this and he took to it quickly. Our foster also initially used a feeder as he had medication on his wet food at the start, took to it immediately. And I used one with my second boy briefly but he scoffs everything down and then goes to other bowls so actually it wasn‚Äôt much use whilst living at home and the dry food that‚Äôs free fed. But again he picked it up very quickly. 

However I am having issues training one of my mums older boys to use a feeder. He seems to have slowed down his eating speed as he gets older and not be able to eat as much at a time, so I thought a chipped feeder would be great for him as we would have to stand guard to tell the three greedy boys to back up and wait if they go for Gavroches food before he had finished. And we aren‚Äôt always able to stand around for 10 minutes after feeding. 

He understands we put his wet food in the feeder. And I‚Äôve reached the point where I can feed everyone in the morning (3 bowls of wet food out for 3 boys that eat it right away, put two bowls into the chipped feeders) and then pick up Gavroche and put him on the counter where they eat. He goes and puts himself into his feeder and eats no issues. He can distinguish which of the two feeders is his even though they are side by side. No issues eating with the other boys around either. 

The issue is that outside of feeding times he doesn‚Äôt go to his feeder. He eats half or more of his portion then leaves for bed. And throughout the day I see him coming to eat dry food 3-4 times and maybe 1-2 times during the night. If I ever intervene and point out his machine he‚Äôll go into it and usually eat the wet food that‚Äôs left, occasionally he‚Äôll back out right away and go to the dry which is fine if that‚Äôs what he wants at the time.

Me and my girlfriend recently adopted a 6 week old Kitten and it's been going relatively great so far. She was mostly an outdoor car but has adjusted without problem. She was underweight and has a parasite from drinking Stillwater on the farm. During the day we've been training her to use the litterbox and it's been going well, she's beginning to use it on her own without prompts from us, but overnight we have her in our bed and she doesn't even make an effort to use the box. She defaults to the same spot on our comforter. Every night we are trying to wake up frequently and put her in the box but as the sleepless nights add up it's harder and harder to wake randomly. 

I've been thinking of keeping her in a cat carrier overnight with an area of paper for her to go but that doesn't really solve the litter problem it just keeps the poop out of our sheets.

His first owner let the cat free roam in the car while he drove and said he was perfectly relaxed, but we don't want to do that (we're very aware of the risks of an unrestrained cat should we have a car accident).

We have a stable carrier we've tried to keep him in during car rides - he just screams the entire time to the point that neither of us can handle it. (And when I say ""screams,"" I don't mean timid little meows - I mean LOUD, yowling screams.) We've tried relaxation spray in the carrier and in the car to no avail. He simply can't relax. 

More recently, I thought I'd try a halfway compromise: put the cat in a harness, leash him to the backseat in such a way that he only has about 1 cubic foot to roam. Not what I'd prefer, but maybe it would make the drive more bearable for all of us.

The first time I tried it, he was much more relaxed. This last time, he wouldn't stop yowling and I had to pull over to retrieve him after he climbed over the back of the back seat (I drive an SUV) - confirming my perception that an ""out"" cat is not a safe cat.

Any ideas for us? We haven't tried drugs (like Dramamine) or the relaxing treats - we were hoping to just get him used to the car. But nothing seems to work.

More recently he's been more aggressive and I have problems with scratching/biting daily. It isn't playful scratching either, it's always aggravated. My guess is it might be because another feral cat has taken over the yard, so he's been a. More anxious, b. Less able to play outdoors and release energy.

EmoRyloKenn,1621712162,niq9hc,3,False,1,"Hi! So background: my husband and I have 2 brother cats who are 1.5 years old. They are both calm, friendly, affectionate, sociable with strangers, vocal, and non aggressive. They are very affectionate with each other as well - always sleeping together and grooming each other. They were both indoor cats until 6 months old and now they go in and out of the house as they please and do not use a litter tray (they will if necessary, but prefer to go outside). 

I have never owned any other cats before so my only experience is with 2 very sociable cats and I don‚Äôt quite get the advice about introducing kittens to cats because they often describe cats as stubborn and territorial, however this just has not been the case for us - they let us hold them like babies, carry them around the house, pick them up, they never hide from us or attack us, and are always near us. We also have a friend with a chihuahua and they get along just fine with him - not playful with him, but curious and respectful of boundaries. 

Now: we have been asked to take in a 9 week old male kitten as the previous owner‚Äôs old adult cat outright rejected him and legitimately tried to kill him last night. The owners are trying to rehome him as soon as possible which means we are picking him up tomorrow. I am reading up on how to introduce the cats to each other, but there is no way I can do a lot of the prep work for it. We also live in a house with no spare room. Our plan right now is to cover the kitten in a blanket from our home to get the scent on him, introduce our cats through a large crate, feed the kitten in a separate area, place several water bowls throughout the house (we actually have 3 already in different places so I might just put out a fourth in a new place that my cats don‚Äôt associate with ‚Äútheir‚Äù space), and if things escalate then we will isolate him in the bathroom for a while. 

What else can I do to make the transition go smoothly?? Everything I have read has been about introducing 1 kitten to 1 cat, not 2 cats.

He really helped us out with a tough situation and I want to publicly show my gratitude by leaving him a positive review.  I recently made a post about a cat that we adopted about 6 months ago who has been very fearful and has refused to leave her room.  He responded in a way that helped us understand that we were not simply dealing with a scaredy cat but a cat who was undersocialized and was most likely neglected by her previous owner.  We suspected that she had been abused or neglected from the start but the undersocialization part was something that we had never considered.  It was only when we read the info that he sent us about socialization that we started to fully understand what we were dealing with.  His info was so enlightening that we decided to pay for some 1 on 1 zoom sessions with him to see if he could help us help our poor cat.  The session was really great and he actually made us feel good by letting us know that we were already doing many of the things that are required to help a scared and undersocialized cat.  His reassurance helped calm our fears but he also made some suggestions that made an immediate impact - mainly related to how we move forward with integrating the new cat with our resident cat.  Since our session, our new cat has actually become more confident and she's leaving her room to explore the house on her own!  After 6 months of adhering to a strict feeding and playtime schedule in her room, we feel like there's finally a light at the end of the tunnel.  Best of all, Stephen is very responsive via email - which is something that I really appreciate because we had worked with another behaviorist months ago who refused to correspond via email (and, in the end, didn't help us one bit with making our situation better).  So, if you are struggling with a situation and you don't know what to do, he's your guy.  I honestly wish we had found him months ago - thanks, Stephen!

always_tired_hsp,1621271742,nem036,0,False,1,"It's a bit tense in our house right now. I have 2 male cats, littermates, about 10 months old. Both neutered. Both allowed outside during the day. 
One of them (Sirius) has always been more dominant than the other (Lupin) but it's never been an issue until now.

For the last couple of weeks I have noticed the following behaviours from Sirus:

- Growling and snarling during playfighting
- Swiping and growling at Lupin when he approaches (e.g. to groom him)
- Hogging all the toys during playtime (up until now, they'd take turns nicely playing with me but now Lupin can't get a look in at all)
- Blocking Lupin's path upstairs or through the window to come in/go out

So far, it's been mostly posturing but it's still really upsetting me to see my little Lupin being bullied like this. I want to comfort him but I worry about making Sirius jealous. My gut feeling is that Sirius feels left out or jealous of Lupin and I don't want to make it worse.

So far I have tried:

&gt; Giving them separate food and water so there is no competition for resources (they still have a litter tray each in the same location but they don't really use them now they are allowed outside so I don't think that could cause competition?)

&gt; Making a point of giving Sirius as much attention as I can and playing with him every day (since they started going outside I haven't been playing with them as much as I thought that they got their 'fix' from the outside world, but I think that maybe I still need to play with them and give them that attention)
There are plenty of places for them to sleep and hide around the house to get away from each other if they need to. They do still sleep next to each other and on Saturday they slept together on my bed so it's not like they're at it constantly.


I should mention that they are very different in personality - Lupin is a complete snugglebum and does that classic cat-flop at my feet constantly, he's so easy to love, but Sirius is harder to reach and seems to be more reserved about asking for affection. He doesn't seem to want or need it that much, but when he does it's adorable. I have often wondered if I have a favourite, and maybe they can both pick up on that?

I have two male cats, brothers, Snoot &amp; Omi, 6 years this December. Up unto this year they were both best friends, cuddling together etc but Omi was always the dominant cat as obvious through play fights. 

Due to the pandemic, we moved to a cheaper (but bigger apartment). Three months in, we noticed Omi began peeing outside the litter box. We took him to the vet three times but they found nothing wrong with him. 

Worse still I had noticed he had been attacking Snoot while Snoot was using the litter box. I assumed this was territorial but the problem is Snoot is a nervous creature and developed a severe blockage of his bladder due to crystal formation. We think it‚Äôs pure stress from being attacked. 

Since then we have tried it all - feliway, multiple litters, playing with them more, keeping them separated (but our apartment is small, so one cat suffers). While keeping them separated, Omi hasn‚Äôt been peeing, reconfirming my thought it was territorial. We brought in a cat behaviourist who tells us that if the separation doesn‚Äôt work, we need to re-home one - and that breaks my heart. 

I am going to take Snoot to my family home for a month. He and I are going to chill, and allow him to convalesce. We‚Äôll reintroduce him and Omi and see how they get on after a regimen of more stimulation, and a diet (they‚Äôre both a little overweight).

I have a very rambunctious and strong-willed 5 y/o cat who loves to explore the outdoors. She‚Äôs strictly indoors, but goes for leashed walks in her harness. She loves this; she loves it so much that she constantly runs out the door (and is damn good at it; jumps over feet/grocery bags/is immune to/likes water spraying. It hasn‚Äôt been a huge problem as I‚Äôve lived in apartments with indoor hallways for the past few years, but we‚Äôre now moving to a house with a new roommate. If she runs out, she‚Äôll be in the neighborhood, and I‚Äôm not sure if she understands that cars are bad/ how to escape from unfriendly animals, etc.

She‚Äôs microchipped, but she‚Äôs a master at getting her collar off. Because of that, I‚Äôm really scared that she‚Äôll get out and make some tailwind (historically when she‚Äôs lived in homes, she‚Äôs crossed streets and other yards when I‚Äôve been trying to bring her back inside). 

Does anyone have any advice on how to keep her away from the door area? I‚Äôve heard clicker training, but when she‚Äôs got an idea in her head, she‚Äôs nearly impossible to stop. I think something distracting or massively deterring could be helpful. 

In addition, does anyone have recommendations for collars that creative kitties struggle to get out of? I don‚Äôt want to put her in a dangerous position where her collar can‚Äôt break away, but she needs to be able to be identified if and when she does make it outside.

Thank you so much in advance. Making plans on keeping my girl safe has been the most stressful/scary part of planning the move, and any advice anyone has to give would be so welcome.",CatTraining,Master escape artist moving to a new house

- Isolating her to her own room so she can have her own litterbox and hopefully re-establish the habit of using the box 

- Moving the box to another location closer to where she wants to potty 

- Sentry cat calming diffuser 

Nothing is working. I wanna catch her in the act so I can scold her and move her to the box while she's doing it but she is so sneaky about it, I've only seen her try to do it a couple times. But I know it's her. Because she is a foster and I never had this issue before I got her, and whenever she is locked in the bathroom or any room without a bed in it, pee stains no longer mysteriously appear. And she has good #2 manners. It's only pee. 

Relevant info: She is about 9 or 10 months old. She has had this problem for as long as I've had her. She is spayed. Spaying didn't improve the issue. She has been taken to the vet. Nothing showed any indicator of a urinary problem but she was given antibiotics ""just in case"" it was a UTI forming. She finished her medicine and still continued to piss on beds. There are 3 other cats in the house, two females and one male, all fixed. We moved into a new house a little while ago (like two months), but she did this even in the old house. Doesn't matter who's bed, she'll piss on anyone's, but one that's mine seems to be her favorites. There are a total of 4 cats and a total of 5 litterboxes. Help. Fuck.

I got one of those petmate playpen things and extended it out as far as it'll go so she has an area that's ""hers"" that's about 4 feet wide by 15 or so feet long. She has toys and food and water and a litterbox and a bed in there and she gets let out to run around under supervision and when we can't let her out we will throw her best friend (another female cat) in there to play and snuggle with her. But she is still bored and confined. I'd love to let her run freely again. And also to stop washing sheets, steam cleaning furniture, having my house smell like Nature's Miracle, etc. The beanbag that she was pissing on is one of those massive beanbags that's like $200 and is 5 feet in all directions. Weighs like 55 pounds. It is completely impossible for me to clean the inside of that thing if my life depended on it. I can only clean the cover, which isn't waterproof.

NoTAP3435,1620752659,na1v1t,11,False,1,"4 years ago my fiance and I took in a 5 month old stray who turned out to be type 1 diabetic (born with it). To manage it, he has to be fed once every 12 hours and given insulin after feeding. This is an issue because he's incredibly food insecure and eats each meal as fast as he can. We thought he would grow out of it but he hasn't.

The issue is he pees when he's frustrated. If he gets hungry and we're asleep, or it's not quite time to feed him yet, he'll walk over to something and pee on it in protest. Frequently we wake up in the morning to find pee on a wall. Just a few minutes ago he was locked in my home office with me while I was on a call (I prefer the door shut), he had been sitting in the window for 30 minutes happy and hanging out, then he wanted out while I couldn't get up yet, and after just 2 minutes of waiting he walked over to my bookshelf and peed on it.

This has been an issue for 4 years. It's not a UTI, we've taken him in a few times because diabetes makes him more prone and he comes back clean. It's not marking, we've tried the scent plug-ins and he's been fixed. He literally just does it to protest. He's got two automatic litterboxes but he'll pee on stuff regardless of how recently they've been cleaned (same day). 

He's been a hugely expensive cat. His insulin costs $2000 per year, he's had ~$7000 in vet bills, and he's ruined ~$2000 in furniture.

It wasn't always a problem, but lately she has been dragging herself across the floor upside down by clawing my mattress like monkey bars. It's super loud when you're laying in the bed, and she does it anywhere from 4:00am-6:00am, usually until I kick her out of the bedroom.

We have a 4 year old spayed female cat (Billie) in a 60sqm flat with no real outdoor access except tiny balconies protected by netting. Billie is sweet, playful, extremely curious and active. She's pretty demanding attention-wise and has been living her best life since we started working from home and she can have all of our attention all day long. I adopted her from a rescue when she was 1yo and we don't know anything from her previous life, only that she was abandonned right after having kittens bc her previous humans didn't want to pay for her spaying. So no idea if she was an outdoor cat, lived with other animals, etc. She was exposed to another cat at least once before since she got pregnant but that's pretty much all we can guess.

We have limited experience with her living with other cats: last year we spent a two month lockdown at my parents' countryside home, where there are two other spayed female free-roaming cats. Billie got along okay with the old one (Cinnamon) who mostly just hissed when she felt her space was being invaded too much, but her relationship with the younger one (Tiny) was a mess. Billie seemed to adopt a dominant position and jumped on every occasion to victimize Tiny, chasing her around the home relentlessly, swatting at her, jumping on her, etc. I'd never seen her so obsessed or agressive, it was horrible. We ended up keeping them apart the entire time we were there, locking either one in their designated bedroom when the other one needed access to the rest of the house. Whenever I bring Billie along for a weekend at my parents', we separate them and it's all good. She tends to be pretty clingy with Cinnamon and likes to hang out around her even though she often gets the cold shoulder. She seems pretty fascinated with her actually, which makes me think she'd appreciate to have a cat companion at home one day.

We just learned one of our friends has an emergency and needs to leave for a week next Saturday (15th May). She has a spayed female cat (named Cat, funnily enough), adult (age unknown), whom she adopted from a rescue a few months ago. Cat is pretty skittish and shy, although she's warmed up to our friend considerably and became very cuddly with her over time. Cat also lives in an indoor-only apartment. 

We only have a few days to prepare and Cat's stay will be pretty short, only seven days, but we'd still like to do everything we can to make sure there's as little stress as possible for the both of them. I've never really done cat introductions before (at my parents' they were accidentally all let together the very first night so that went out the window) but I know the basics (doors closed, scent-marked objects, feeding on either side of the doors, etc.). Since we'll only have a week, I'm wondering if it's even worth introducing them? Keeping them separate would be a bit of a hassle though : I don't like the idea of restricting access to some of the space to Billie since there's not that much space to begin with, and basically we'd have to keep Cat in our bedroom (and en suite bathroom for her litterbox) which is a pretty small room, whereas the other rooms are nicer/have more hiding spots. The flat is basically star-shaped, with an entryway and four rooms independantly attached to it: kitchen, living, small office, bedroom+bath. 

So basically: what can I do beforehand and once Cat gets here to make sure both her and Billie are as chill as possible and also don't get any lasting bad effects from their interaction?

She is a little weary of strangers but we live in a very quiet neighborhood with low foot traffic.

Tonight though, she ventured a little further than usual. she looked confident (uppity tail) and led the way. Suddenly, About 5 feet away from us, someone turned on their car engine and she got spooked.

She ran, and i ran behind her while holding the leash, but in the end I had to let it go since i couldnt keep up with her speed (i dont know if that says something about my athletic condition lol). i also didnt want to scare her further by tugging it too hard. Luckily she ran all the way back to my front door. We were probably around 100 feet from my house.

My question is: next time, how should I handle this? If something unexpected happens and she runs away and I cant keep up, do i keep holding on to the leash and tug on it?? Or should I let it go because tugging on it may scare her? I dont ever plan on taking her further from my quiet neighborhood, so can i count on the fact that she knows where my house is??

We decided to get one of those cat flaps that reads his microchip, and I think the issue is that it makes a click sound when it unlocks and he will not go through it to come into the house. I can't even push him through as he just won't do it. He ends up locked out as I don't think it clicks when he goes out and so he gets stuck. 

I'd really appreciate some tips. He uses other, regular cat flaps, and will go through if it's propped open, but obvs bully cat can come in too which defeats the purpose of spending ¬£50 on a fancy cat flap!

I‚Äôve had my cat since august, when he was ~7 months old, he‚Äôs now 15 months old and calming down slowly. He is fixed and we have a healthy schedule of play, eat and sleep. He is very sweet at times, sleeps next to my bed on a box he likes and then in the morning usually comes to wake me up and sleep on my chest. 

Outside of these moments, Occasionally something snaps and then he thinks he needs to attack. The last two times have been as follows:


1.  He was being playful so I gave him his kicker toy and usually I tug on it gently and he gets really into it kicking and biting the toy. He was playing and I pet him on his back and he usually is fine with that but he stopped and dropped the toy and swat at me. So I backed off and tried to get him back into the toy but he tried to swat me again so I stood up and figured play time was over and to leave him alone. He then sat up and then tried to jump at me on my leg. So I shrieked as I do when he bites me. But he was still focused on me and let out a small meow like as if he was nervous. And we were at a bit of a stand off so I grabbed a bucket I have near me to just block him and ‚Äúsnap him out of it‚Äù. It distracted him enough and he was fine after.


2. Today I was in the kitchen making breakfast and he came over and was by my feet which he often is.  I crouched down because he likes to circle me while I pet him and then he bit me. So I stood up cause I guess we were done with the amount of attention he wanted. I turned to go back to making breakfast and again he wanted to come after my leg. I screamed and he backed off once I walked away a little. 


I‚Äôve had cats before but I have never had a cat flip on me while playing or petting. My old cat would get over stimulated and yes she‚Äôd nip once she‚Äôd had enough which I‚Äôm used to but I don‚Äôt even know how to deal with these outbursts. I wanted a cat who was cuddly and more relaxed. I worked through his high amount of energy when I got him and I have bonded with him over the time I‚Äôve owned him, he‚Äôs super fearless which I love (to a detriment lol) I just want to understand his behaviour...

beau-thoreau,1620315629,n6a657,6,False,1,"Hello all,

I have a lovely but also mischievous 1 year old cat. When she was younger she loved to mess with my plants because they interested her, however, now she only disturbs them when she wants me to play with her or feed her. I have to be careful not to overfeed her because she really likes to eat.

I do give her a lot of attention. We play fetch (her favorite game) every day, usually multiple times a day. My issue is that she will claw, bite, and step on my plants when she wants more attention, which usually occurs when I am busy working and can't give her my attention.

I do not want to reinforce this behavior by rewarding it with giving in to playing with her because then she will learn to keep doing it. I don't believe any form of punishment would be effective either. And I do not want to jeopardize my relationship with her by punishing her.

So I'm here to ask for advice on how to get her to not attack my plants. I have tried spraying them with a cat deterrent spray but she appears to be unaffected by the supposedly unpleasant smell.

Is the only solution to put up a barrier when she does this (I currently place multiple objects around my plants when she attacks them but she still manages to get through and wreak havoc)?",CatTraining,HELP! Cat attacks my plants for attention
PoopEndeavor,1620278946,n601jg,9,False,1,"I posted recently about training my cat to eat more gently, but I also have this issue with her randomly attacking me. Problem is, everything I've read says that I should respond by making a loud high-pitched noise (as if I were a kitten indicating she was playing too hard) and withdraw attention. I found her in the street so wonder if maybe she didn't have kitty siblings to learn socialization from. Anyway, **the problem is, it almost seems to make her even more set on attacking me! She keeps coming at me no matter how much I express ""pain"" noise and try to get away.** Which kind of makes sense given that cats like squeaky toys and hunting animals that squeak/chirp (mice and birds).

I try to play with her a few times a day (string toys) and take her outside in the yard and on walks so that she gets plenty of stimulation, but she still finds my body movements (especially toes and feet) to be irresistible prey at random moments and **she won't stop attacking unless I do one of the following: shout really loud, fling her away, fend her off with a pillow, or spray her with water.** 

At this point, I'm covered in bites and scratches - not gentle ones. She draws blood. I know the difference between a ""please stop petting me"" warning-bite that doesn't break skin, and a ""my eyes are fixed on you, you are my dinner"" kind of bite. Totally unprompted, I can literally just be standing there. It's not like I wiggle my hands in her face. She's SO sweet and playful the rest of the time - follows me around, lays down near or on me, loves head/face pets, does great during training sessions and on walks.

faebugz,1620278593,n5zyjj,1,False,1,"Basically, there's a cat which is always in my neighborhood -they either belong technically to my neighbor two doors down, or they're stray- that is usually very much a loner.

Well for the last 3 nights in a row, she has been sitting in the same spot in my yard for hours. This spot is particular because: it's relatively secluded, yet not far from our house (behind carport wall). And it also has our old homemade smoker from smoking salmon last fall. In fact, she's parked herself front and center in front of the open door to it. It's basically a small wooden a frame, like the size of a dog house. We were lazy and didn't clean the salmon drippings out of it, so it probably smells pretty intense. It would also be the perfect spot to put kittens or babies, except during the day there is a bit of traffic in the area (bf's hammock is nearby). I did check it out during the day yesterday, and no sign of anything inside it.     

Basically, I can't figure out why she's sitting there every night. It's so out of character. She still won't accept food either. Any insights anyone? Are babies on the horizon?

lanuette,1620232697,n5k9pv,2,False,1,"I have two cats that are a year old now and i've been harness/leash training them for about 9 months now so that they can get some outdoor stimulation and enjoy the sun, they are primarily indoor cats otherwise. We go outside at 7am every morning on my front lawn for an hour and they sniff around and chill in the morning sun and watch people walk to school, jog, bike, ect. Obviously they are cats and are naturally not OK about fast moving things like bikes and vehicles, but the front yard is large enough that they have enough space to move away if they aren't alright with something passing by and they have gotten to the point where they are comfortable being on the edge of the property by the sidewalk when something/someone goes by. They have been comfortable doing this for about 2 months now so I feel somewhat confident letting them walk to the back of the house and across the back alley where there are some birds and trees for them to observe and smell. (something they have wanted to do for awhile but I kept them on the property) there is even a pond further back that has ducks that they can watch swim around. 

The problem here is that there are people who bike back there and unlike the front yard, if something scares them they don't have the security of putting distance between them like with the yard out front. They will be on a much shorter leash so if need be I can reach them to scoop them up and take them home.

 So I was wondering if there was a way to desensitize them to bikes so if someone passes by they won't panic?

11 days ago we adopted a 5 year old cat.

She's really sweet during the day. She already seems at ease and confident in our home. However, every night, at around 10 pm she starts yowling and pacing the appartment as if she's looking for something. We're still awake, so it's not because she can't see us anymore (during the day when I'm away from home, she doesn't do this either - I filmed her).

I feel like we are trying everything. Feliway, bach flower therapy, ... I went to the vet and she doesn't really know what's up either, thinks it's just because she's still a little disoriented. It's nothing physical.

When she starts doing this, we take her with us on the couch, she doesn't stay. We try to play with her, but she's not really interested.

But why does she only do this at night? We're starting to think that maybe she misses to go outside. With her previous owners she was able to go outside, even though she was scared and didn't go much further than the windowsill - maybe this was enough for her? Or maybe she misses her feline friend? Even though her previous owners say that they weren't that close and that the other cat was usually away from home (they basically just slept in the same room).

sadkaoo,1620196306,n59b0n,0,False,1,"I brought my 3 month Taro home 6 days ago and kept her in a separate room away from resident cat Kimchi. I made the mistake of assigning Taro's home base as my bedroom, which was also Kimchi's home base and probably the room she is attached to the most. I kept them apart for 4-5 days and fed them bowl-door-bowl with roughly a foot apart. Basically, I'm taking cat-introduction advice from Jackson Galaxy.

For the past two days, I've been allowing visual contact through cracked doors and supervised in an open room. I allow them to interact in an open room because they play footsies completely okay under the door with no signs of aggression. In open-room play time, I let Kimchi watch Taro play with the fishing rod, while I hold a piece of cardboard in my hand to stop any potential fights. Kimchi growls and hisses when Taro gets within 1.5 ft of her; otherwise, her eyes are glued on Taro. Taro is very innocent and doesn't seem to be sacred of Kimchi. She's either brave or clueless, because she does not heed Kimchi's hisses and growls. She only gets scared and defensive when Kimchi goes out of her way to attack Taro. 

Today, Kimchi went out of her way to attack at Taro twice. Once in the afternoon while we were in my living room during a play session, and again in my bedroom (*Kimchi's precious territory)* at night. Kimchi is now laying at the edge of my door; it's very obvious she's protective of her own home base. After learning my mistake of stupid home-base assignment, I've been keeping Taro in my brother's room.

Currently,  they both lose their minds around food/treats (we are scheduled twice a day with treats before bed, previously just because but now only with training)

Currently I'm trying to get them to just sit calmly rather than jumping all over me and biting/clawing at my hands for treats and I'm seeing some progress they know when and where treats happen and are slightly less obnoxious,  they only get the click/treat when they sit.

This is of course challenging with 2, since trying to reinforce desired behavior they don't both cooperate but I think they are getting it, I'm adding in a hand and voice ""sit"" I tried locking up one but the other would go bonkers trying to get out of the room and it just got everyone upset and unable to focus.   Also I mentioned the food motivated part? Giving one food or treats makes the other too distracted as he's trying to get what the other has.

So basically any suggestions for clicker training is what I'm looking for.  

1. Like the cat gives desired behavior I click, but as I'm Giving the treat he moves and tries to grab the treat, do I abort? Or is that mixed messages? I perhaps should have started with begging as they already were doing it, but it was chaotic and I could see no way forward without some sort of wait/calm behavior 

2. Has anyone ever had luck with a ""leave it"" type of training with cats?  Earl not only is a counter surfer, but he tries to snatch bites off plates and stalks me when I'm trying to eat.  I'm not sure how to use clicker training to stop undesirable behavior like what can I introduce to keep them off the counter when I'm not there or from jumping onto my plate?  I've tried putting his food in puzzle toys, but every day after he goes hunting for more.

3.  I had also hoped to use clicker to do nail trim with Earl, he is overly sensitive,  I can't even touch his feet asleep it wakes him right up.  Using treats brings Gus though and no one is relaxed anymore.  I had thought to use the clicker for maybe a burrito or cat sack training because the burrito didn't go well either.   At this point I'm looking at the vet probably I've tried all the tricks and I've had other cats and generally could get nails even if just one or two but Earl might just have a psychosis.

He often has, what my sister thinks is the zoomies, I don't know too much about the term and its meaning but he just runs around, does the ""mrrp"" sound whenever he sees us, jumps on the couch under things as if he is being followed and just runs around very energetically.

Now as he has gotten older, he is now around 12\~13 weeks old he has also gotten bigger and stronger, he often, even since the beginning bit our hands and feet, I often did the loud ""ouch"" and some days ago I started doing the ""ouch"" also with a hiss so that he might get scared but I don't know if this can maybe lead to him being even more hostile and maybe scared of me.

Also whenever he does something bad, like scratch us, mainly I my sister and mother do that, my father doesn't really care, we let out an ""ouch"" and often also leave the room or go away from him.

I know that some of it is just playing but its really not too nice for us, all of us have scratch marks and him getting bigger every day means he now even jumps up onto my leg/arms trying to climb up biting and scratching me.

Note that I don't know if this all just playing or him being hostile, because he rarely hisses us, only whenever he is playing or not wanting to get disturbed and someone pets him.

He never really hisses at our appearence, only maybe runs away.

Are there any tips on what we should do? 

I understand that we have to exhaust him and we really do, whenever we play with him he even lets out the exhaustion breathing where his mouth is open while breathing but one minute later he is back being crazy jumping around biting our hands feet arms legs.

Runcible-Spork,1619853538,n2dehp,5,False,1,"I got my rescue, Oliver, when he was a little over a year old. I'm not exactly sure what his conditions in that first year were like, but he was thrown out a second-storey window in the middle of a Canadian winter and had to be coaxed out from under a shed. Oh, and he wasn't house trained. 

Fortunately, those poor conditions didn't make him violent or feral. For the last three years, he's been the sweetest, most amazing little buddy. I've got him playing with toys, running around, and generally being happy. 

Recently, however, my room mate got a new kitten. We're talking a bona fide smoll boi, 3 months old, not even 2 lbs. 

And he's bullying Oliver. 

Ollie is no stranger to other cats. When I first brought him home, there was a very lazy 16-lb. cat in the house already who didn't really mind Oliver's presence. They never fought, just cuddled. It was very, very cute. 

Then I moved, and the person I lived with slowly accumulated three cats, and each time it was a nice, seamless transition from one cat to, ultimately, four by the time I moved out. 

When I moved in with my current room mate last year, his cat at the time was maybe half Oliver's size, and quickly took to bullying Ollie. She'd back him into a corner and stare him down, hunt him around the place, etc. They cooled off after a while, but we'd still have to separate them at night to ensure there was no trouble. Whenever they fought, it was very one-sided, with Oliver crouching down and trying not to be threatening while vocalizing as the other cat took swipes. 

When my roomie gave up his shared custody of that cat with his ex and decided to get a new kitten, I figured that Oliver would finally get to have a buddy again. 

Unfortunately, this new kitten is starting to do the same thing... following Ollie until he's backed into a corner, being aggressive with his playfulness until it kind of turns into something not playful. 

Anyway, this has me thinking: as much as I love how sweet Ollie is, maybe what I need to do is somehow teach him to stand up for himself and not let himself get pushed around by a little pipsqueek 1/5th his weight. I've no idea how I'd do this, though. I've never had to teach a cat to defend itself. 

About the new kitten... the foster parent assured my roomie that he got along well with other cats, and he is generally well-behaved for a kitten. We just recently started letting them be in the same room together after giving them a week-long period to acclimate to each others' scents, letting them in different parts of the apartment at different times. There's been no hissing or screetching, just some brief tackles and cornering that leaves one of them with a puffed up tail. I'm hoping to help Ollie stand up for himself before the kitten learns to just walk all over him forever. 

I'd appreciate if anyone has any thoughts on this situation. Have I coddled my little guy too much? Is this just a phase before they settle into a more stable dynamic? 

Thanks!",CatTraining,Teaching my cat to fight back?

He used to be indoor/outdoor until he was hit by a car 4 years ago and has been strictly indoor since. He lives with 2 female cats and they all share two litter boxes (I‚Äôve tried adding more and they never used the others). He lives with my 5 dogs and bosses them around, no issues there. 

I recently started boarding dogs. Right now I have regulars (GSD and GSD mix). Both respect the cats and have no issues with him. Axle has HUGE issues with them though and I don‚Äôt know why.

Since I started boarding them (on and off the past month) Axle has peed on our expensive couch multiple times. We have replaced the cushions, cleaned what we could with an enzymatic spray multiple times, and have resorted to putting mattress covers on them. It got so bad that we have set up a kennel for him with a litter box to sleep in at night (that‚Äôs when he‚Äôs been doing it). Just this morning, I found a new pee spot.

cubs_fan35,1619758102,n1mk7o,25,False,1,"Warning - long post and request for help ahead.  We adopted a cat from the anti-cruelty society about 6 months ago and she completely refuses to leave her room.  When we first adopted her, she was a shell of a cat - probably the most scared cat I‚Äôve ever met.  It seems as if she may have been mistreated at her previous home and a ‚Äúfriend of the family‚Äù dumped her in the shelter without providing much info on her.  From what we can tell, she‚Äôs a rag doll and she‚Äôs 2-3 years old.  My wife and I have had cats for over 20 years so we figured we were well equipped to give her a good home as we‚Äôve dealt with abused cats and cats with chronic illnesses in the past and they all turned out fine.  They just need lots of love.  For additional context here, we do have another cat - he‚Äôs a 10 year old Norwegian Forest Cat and he‚Äôs a very kind and gentile guy - and he‚Äôs good with other cats.  We adopted her a few months after our 17 year old cat passed away.  

When we first brought the new cat home, she hid under a blanket for a week straight.  She would meow and hiss at us when we came into the room (from under the blanket) but it wasn‚Äôt aggression, it was fear.  During this time, we did not make any attempt to pet her or even really come near her.  We would bring in food and make sure her litter boxes were clean but we would also sit in her room and just talk to her or read to her from a distance.  Eventually, she mustered up the courage to come out and eat while we were in the room.  After about two weeks, she was brave enough to approach us for some light pets.  We were careful to move at her pace and we never forced anything on her.  

Shortly after that, she developed an issue with peeing outside of her litter box but as it turns out, it was due to an aggressive UTI that took about a month to clear up.  At first, the vet misdiagnosed it and told us it was FIC and refused to do a Irvine sample.  I ended up going to another vet who did the proper testing and got us on the road to recovery.  For that reason, we‚Äôre considering that first 4-6 weeks a complete wash because it‚Äôs safe to say that she wasn‚Äôt feeling well.  

Shortly after being cleared of the UTI, she would actually start coming out of her room for short periods.  Sometimes it would take a bit of coaxing but other times, she would waltz right out.  We would always put up a baby gate during this time to ensure that the two cats didn‚Äôt see each other as we wanted her to get more comfortable with the new space.  With that being said, there was one time where the gate at the top of the stairs was breached by the resident cat and he made his way down the stairs - we had a second gate up so they didn‚Äôt come in contact but they did see each other and it actually seemed to go well.  This was probably a month after being cleared of the UTI.  Prior to that encounter, we had been doing regular scent swapping sessions by using the same brush on both cats or feeding them near a towel that had been rubbed on the other cat.  After the encounter, we started doing some of the more traditional introduction tactics (feeding on either side of a closed door, then feeding with the door cracked open, then feeding on either side of a baby gate, and eventually feeding in the same room).  The intro has gone relatively well - maybe a couple of hisses from the new cat at first but no real aggression.  They‚Äôve touched noses a few times and will happily eat in the same room but it‚Äôs not really progressing beyond that.  At times, it seems like they have little interest in each other.  Now that we‚Äôve been doing this for over a month though, the new cat completely refuses to come out of her room.  We have tried doing a room swap and she‚Äôs actually so scared that she typically pees on the floor and then panics until she‚Äôs brought back to her safe room.  She doesn‚Äôt really like to be picked up so as soon as we try to handle her, she gets upset and will sometimes pee on whoever is picking her up.  She‚Äôs come a long way since we adopted her but It‚Äôs starting to feel like we‚Äôre never going to get her out of her room and integrated into the rest of our home.  Does anyone have experience with this?  Any advice?  Here‚Äôs everything we‚Äôve tried so far:

- The house is bombed with feliway
- We hired a feline behaviorist (one who is highly regarded but will go unnamed) to help us and aside from assuring us that her peeing problem was a UTI rather than behavioral, she wasn‚Äôt worth the money.
- We have her on a prescription calm food
- She gets 2 capsules of zylkene a day to help with her anxiety
- We initially tried gabapentin to calm her anxiety and it didn‚Äôt work.
- We tried amitriptyline, didn‚Äôt work
- We tried buspar, didn‚Äôt work
- we have her on a reliable routine with feeding and playtime

Over the past few weeks, she has actually seemed to regress a bit.  She‚Äôs less playful and now she sometimes refuses to even leave the chair that she likes to sleep in.  She will purr when petted but she doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested in coming down from her chair to play anymore.  We‚Äôre at the point where this is dragging on much longer than anticipated and it‚Äôs impacting our lives as we feel like we‚Äôre being held hostage by her routine.   At this point, we couldn‚Äôt possibly rehome her but we have to find a way forward.  She‚Äôs really sweet and we just want to give her a good life and a good home but we‚Äôre having trouble with figuring out how to do that for her.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My cat is of higher energy and I play with him 15-30 minutes in the morning, right after work, and at night before bed around 9ish).  In the morning still, while I work 8-12 he still seems to go after a few cabinets (which he learned to open) that I have locked and wrapped in brown paper to ensure he doesn't scratch or bite, which he is still trying to do.

While I'm trying sticky paws, deterrent, etc. I'm trying basically to tucker him out consistently before/after work.  Nothing seems to be fully working.  he just constantly wants to explore the cabinets or sit on the laptop.

The self-play toys he used to love, he no longer likes and I'm running out of safe toys to rotate in.  I've been rotating with play the bird, snake, cat catcher which he loves, and a bird on a stick.  He never really full runs except for the laser pointer, but he does jump and pounce.

He seems to be sick of the trackballs, mice, the box I made him to deter him from the cabinet the tunnels he only likes during the night.

Sometimes he'll like to sit near me and I'll just pet him but my worry is (a) I can't do that all the time during work and (b) eventually I will end up going back to work

2. She has not been around other cats (except for the male who made her pregnant a few weeks after she showed up at my house... she  is now spayed).

Vaches,1619349654,my6bir,5,False,1,"**Preamble:** My boyfriend has had this cat since he was a kitten, and he didn't encounter anything like this until fall of last year. Our next step is a vet appointment to maybe request CBD drops, but since I don't know a whole lot about cat behaviour, I also want to explore other options. He went to the vet a few months ago and he's otherwise completely healthy.

**The story:** Quasimodo (Quasi) is 3 years old and has been almost completely blind since birth. While he's nervous of strangers, he's a very sweet, cuddly, and playful cat; his blindness didn't seem to stop him from being adventurous. Last fall, we got a new coffee table and a desk for the computer room; I'm not sure if there's a proper introduction process to new furniture or something, but he has been nervous of this room ever since. One evening, he spooked himself -- he tried to jump onto a chair and fell, and he subsequently tore through the apartment in fear. For the next 4 weeks, he was terrified of everything and wouldn't leave the bed by himself. We carried him to his food bowl, to the litterbox, and played with him on the bed. He eventually grew more confident and acted like his old self, so we figured it was a one-time thing.

This has happened another 3 times since then. He'll be with us in the computer room, something like a noise or sudden movement will startle him, and he will tear through the apartment. Quasi gave my boyfriend a nasty facial scar when he tried to claw his way up to the back of the couch. Then he will stay on the bed for a week or two until he regains his confidence.

The most concerning thing, to me, is that the last time he got spooked, it was in the bedroom, which is supposed to be the ""safe zone"". I didn't see it happen, but I was told that Quasi misjudged a jump from the bed to the nightstand and fell to the floor. When I first met Quasi 2 years ago, he fell off the bed all the time during playtime, and he'd hop back up without hesitation.

**What we've tried:** We've tried carrying him literally everywhere, until we figured we were probably encouraging the behaviour. We've tried leaving him alone and letting him figure out how to get to us/his food bowl/his litterbox, but I sometimes get worried that he'll feel abandoned, so I try to balance between carrying him sometimes and other times let him work it out on his own. We've tried carrying him to the same place he got scared to see if he'll ""realize"" that it's safe -- this definitely didn't work, 0/10, do not recommend.

He‚Äôs a one year old siamese cat and he has a sister, my beautiful tuxedo girl, who‚Äôs also a year old and both are fixed. 

I work from home so my cats get plenty of play in between morning, noon and evening after their meals. I take them out into the yard at noon so they can just lounge around. They also love to chase each other just before their morning nap. I sleep at around 10pm so their last meal is around 9 to 930 ish and then I spend the last 30 minutes wearing them out. 

The problem is my Siamese won‚Äôt stop meowing at night till around 5 or 6am, sometimes 9am and now it has progressed to a whole day of meowing until he can go out at noon time. I don‚Äôt know what he wants since he gets plenty of play time the whole day. He doesn‚Äôt want food or water and he also does not want to use the litterbox. He wants to go out of the house. 

Someone in the r/cats sub pointed out that it could be separation anxiety but they both can come and go as they please in our rooms. He doesn‚Äôt meow at us or try to paw us but rather walks around yowling loudly in the living area and around the main door trying to find ways to get out. 

They have plenty of toys which I cycle around, a ball feeder, cat trees and a hanging cat bed right by the window. Our house is very well catified. We cannot allow them both to be outdoor cats because they will get lost so that isn‚Äôt an option.

Anewdaytomorrow,1619272374,mxkekn,13,False,1,"Hi I'm hoping someone can give me some guidence here. I'm a little lost on how to break through to my kitten.

Long story short. My GF and I adopted a 4 month old from a rescue group. Penny (the kitten) came from outside along with two other siblings and only seems to get along with other cats.. she even bonded with the other rescues rather quickly. Also she's not fixed (yet). We also have an 8 year old cat that is separated from her, penny is in the guest room while Marlowe has the rest of the apt they do know the exist from under the door (marlowe only hisses) but we haven't begun to introduce them since we feel she should get used to humans first before making the jump to Marlowe.

Timeline:

She was very tramatized from the car ride home and was shaking like crazy. A day later she calmed down but still hissed when we got close and darted away. One by one we took away hiding spots that she discovered but kept one, behind the exercise bike since it's open and not a cave. We felt like that was better than her hiding in a small dark spot under something. We finally got to a point where she actually eats in front of us and even eats food off our hands! She even will out her front paws on our knees to reach the food. 

The steps back... She doesn't seem to make the connection between hands and food, yes she will eat off ours but when we don't have food she will hiss at our hand and swat. No association seems to be happening. She does like to play with us when we have the stick string toy but sometimes it takes 25mintues of swinging it to get her to even start playing. 

Last night I slept in the room (on the floor) and I woke up to her climbing all over my legs I laid still and let her have fun and eventually went back to sleep. But once I fully woke up eventually she saw me from across the room and hissed and hid. 

Not really sure what I can do better? Any advice?

Random note: I have an VR Headset (Oculus Quest 2) and it has passthrough vision which basically means I can see the room via the cameras on the headset while it's on my face. I was casually watching a movie in the room with her and switched to passthrough and was amazed that was came up to me to sniffed me a few times. So my guess is she seems to not care for eyes...

shakes_mcjunkie,1619132431,mwh97n,12,False,1,"Hello! I've had a couple lovely cats since December that were around 3 months old. In about February, I think one of them scratched the other cat on the face leaving some fairly cosmetic wounds on her face. I wasn't sure what to do and figured maybe the wounds would heal up on their own. However, she continued to scratch at them until I pretty much had to cone her. I took her to the vet and they gave me some antiseptic ointment to apply to the wounds and a steroid to apply to the area to prevent scratching once the wounds closed up.

There were several setbacks mostly because I couldn't find a cone that fit a kitten properly. Eventually, after several weeks, the wounds healed up and I took the cone off. About a week later she reopened one of the larger wounds I think from scratching it. I took her to the vet again and got a full screen, blood work, check for mites and parasites, etc. They found nothing and sent me home with an antihistamine in case it's allergies.

Well, it's been about another week and a half and she's still trying to scratch at it. The cone I have is fairly sturdy but she seems very agitated constantly, presumably because her face is itchy, and has been finding ways to scratch her face on various corners of things we have around the house. It doesn't seem like allergies because the antihistamine hasn't really reduced her itchiness. It's been immensely frustrating that she's been in a cone for almost 6 weeks on and off at this point. I've been very strict this time around about keeping the cone on until it's healed but I'm worried it's contributing to maybe drying out her skin and causing it to be itchy.

All that is to say, I'm wondering if anyone else has had to deal with a similar situation? If so, how have you dealt with it? Are there any lotions to help keep her skin hydrated or anti-itch ointments to apply to the area? How do we keep her from finding ways to scratch herself?

art9818,1619078029,mvzvhp,3,False,1,"Hello!

Due to the passing of a close relative I have come to adopt a 2-year-old cat. I live in a one-room (+ kitchen in a separate room) apartment (33 m^(2)  /355 ft^(2)) where the one room houses my bed but also couch, tv, coffee table, etc. Transitioning to the new apartment, the cat was not ecstatic but seems to have adjusted to the new living space fine. However, there are several problems that come with her earlier upbringing. Since she used to live in a less strict and organized environment she has the tendency to do what she pleases when she pleases.   
This comes in several forms:

1. She will wake up at crack of dawn and do everything to wake me and my partner up by scratching the furniture, climbing walls, jumping on the bed, etc. The reason for her acting out is not to get food but rather to get our attention so we could pet/interact with her. And even if we interact with her until she feels satisfied (walks away from us) then in about 20 minutes she starts doing it again.
2. She always has food around but at any moment she can refuse the food and show that by pretend ""hiding"" it in the ground as if she was on the toilet. This ends in a lot of food going to waste since nothing changes her mind and makes her want to eat it anymore. (She also smells our food and does the same ""hiding"" if the smell is not to her liking)
3. She is used to being able to stretch and scratch anything she wants. She will climb up walls, scratch our fake leather couch and our cabinets and tables. Repeatedly stopping her and taking her to her cat tree with several appropriate scratching posts has not yielded any results. 
4. It is not possible to do any procedures like taking her to the vet, cutting her nails, etc. She is very afraid of her traveling cage and she does not accept being carried anywhere. To move her to this apartment we were able to wrap her in a blanket and put her in the traveling cage but this made her afraid of all blankets.

His feeding regiment was:

* 1 5.5oz can of wet food (he LOVES Weruva stews) half in the morning and half at night
* 1/4 cup of dry food for monching on during the day. He actually  doesn't even finish it until the next morning
* 5 or 6 treats during play. 

As far as his usual food-related behavior, it was general excitement/meowing during feeding time. Occasionally being a pain in the ass when the humans are eating, and occasionally trying (and succeeding) to steal food left unattended. I've caught him running through the house like a bandit with a piece of proscuitto hanging out of his mouth that he stole from a charcuterie board when we had company one time. 

Ok so now his new diet consists of the same 5.5oz can of wet food but drastically reduced the dry food since it has the highest carb content, and no treats. I can understand he's probably hungry but now during feeding time he's up on the counter and trying to nudge me out of the way before I can even get the food out of the can. I don't think ""aggressiveness"" is the correct word because he's not hissing/growling, etc.. he's actually very docile. Food over-excitement is probably a better descriptor.  He also gobbles his food down and licks the bowl clean like a lunatic, whereas before he took his time. When we (the humans) eat I have to put him in time-out in the next room otherwise he'll be all up in our plates. Ok so he's hungry.

I just got a new kitten on Saturday and am having no success with litter box training. Most of the resources online talk about adult cats and not kittens so I'm hoping someone here has some helpful advice. She started pooping on the couch the other day and now it's become a routine for her. I've tried putting her in the box and digging her paws in the litter, but she struggles to get away and runs as soon as I let go of her. The vet suggested stimulating her behind with wet paper towel strips above the litter box, but she does not take well to that so I've stopped for a couple days and I will try again after her vet appointment tomorrow. She tucks her tail between her legs to block me and then runs away when I let her go. It almost seems like she's repulsed by the litter because she refuses to even smell it or explore around it. I even tried putting the litter box on the couch in the spot where she's been pooping, but she just poops right next to it! This has been frustrating and nothing I've tried seems to be working.

I'm not sure if maybe she doesn't like the cardboard box and that could be why? Maybe I can try putting litter in the spare box and see if she'll try that since it has my other cat's scent on it.

I was told he was a spayed female and I was excited for the addition to my home. However upon arriving, he was a non-neutered little guy.

Pat, to put it simply, is an asshole. Food crazy, overly needy, world revolves around him and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He's learned to open my cabinets. So I had to get childproof locks so he would stop eating everything in my trash and leave me the mess. Also so he would not try to eat any rice or sweets in the pantry cupboards.

He began clawing excessively at my door so I bought a 4 foot gate but he learned to jump and sit on top of it. So I got a big wooden slab to lean against the door. Hes learned to just knock it over. This guy has a scream that can KILL, alright. I keep my door closed at all times because he has killed a gerbil of mine and I fear my others getting caught.

I got him neutered in January and it only seemed to make EVERYTHING worse. He began chewing on my toothbrush, eating my phone chargers. Eating my rubber straws(swallowing everything, as well!!!) He has broken my vision glasses, a wine glass, 2 shot glasses, and various potted plants. He has began clawing at my furniture and chewing on my bigger plants.

I just. I'm getting so tired of this. I've tried clicker training and got so desperate for him to just chill that I began clicking it when he even just SITS by the plant while not eating it. But then he attacks me for the treats and screams and acts like he has never eaten before. And then its a whole ordeal every time to put the ""special"" treats away. My other cat took very well to clicker training and she has always been lovely since adopting her.

I bought him a new water fountain, take him on drives, take him on walks outside, at least 15 new toys were bought for him. I began feeding him a bit more in the AM thinking he wasnt eating enough but that still didnt change anything. After grocery shopping or cooking, I give him 2 chances before putting him in his room(the cats have their own bedroom I'm not sorry). I try and feed into their curiosity by letting them smell what I'm doing. But Pat will get ONE hint of some kind of food and go absolutely APESHIT. Clawing at me for it, jumping on me, anything. So his curiosity time i ended and he's put away until I'm done. One time, he got me gashed straight across my nose- ouch.

My 7 month old kitten Cookie has a bad habit of biting. He seems to only communicate through biting. For example, when hes in super playful mode and playing with the wand toy, he‚Äôll get distracted mid-play and attack who ever is nearby. Another thing is that he will start purring sometimes if i walk into the room, so i go to pet him and he immediately turns his head around to bite. 

I‚Äôve never experienced this kind of behaviour with cats, i understand a little biting if hes overstimulated or something is okay but he does it a lot. 

I‚Äôve had so many injuries from him, but he was neutered 2 weeks a go and the crazy attacking has stopped but he‚Äôs still very apprehensive to petting. 

I took him in a month ago and at first he was soo much more friendly so i dont know why he‚Äôs doing this now. Also, i‚Äôve tried so many techniques i read online like telling him a firm ‚Äúno‚Äù, acting like im in pain, leaving the room when he bites etc but nothing seems to work.

AdaptivePerfection,1618677385,msu186,4,False,1,"I have 2 kittens and I was wondering whether to train them in the same language or different ones.

From what I can tell through researching, it seems the general consensus is that ‚Äúmonkey-see, monkey-do‚Äù occurs when it‚Äôs the same language for both cats. This can be beneficial in that while it‚Äôs only really possible to train one cat at a time directly, if the other cat is observing, he will still end up learning something. The next training session which would be with the other cat would then be easier because using the same command and remembering what he saw the other cat do, he‚Äôd then be easier to train.

The only reason I can think of that‚Äôd make sense to not train them each in the same language is to not have the cats be confused if I say a certain command and they each think I‚Äôm talking to both of them.

Half the time, he's a perfect little angel, really snuggly, will butt hands for attention and plays fetch with his little mouse toys (I will upload this at some point to show off how clever my little guy is!)

The rest of the time, he is a feral little monster who will just attack your hands/feet/whatever is in reach. Not one form of discipline works. Spray bottles, putting him in a different room, telling him no, like honestly this cat does not give a shit. He will give you side eye and do it again. 

This would all be managable, but we're due our daughter in less than a month and Im in pregnancy freak out that the cat is gonna bite my kid.

The oldest is approximately 10 and she was a stray, so she is VERY wary around other cats but usually fine with people. The other resident cat had some trauma involving people when she was a kitten and is very wary around people, but wasn‚Äôt too bad with the older cat being brought home. The older cat was aggressive with her and my roommates who own the two didn‚Äôt really do a good job introducing them. They‚Äôre ‚Äúcoexisting‚Äù now, but begrudgingly and mostly just avoid each other entirely. The new kitten is less than a year and she was found by myself in the hood of my friend‚Äôs car during a thunderstorm while we were at the beach. I ended up taking her home and she‚Äôs been a dream so far, LOVES people. We didn‚Äôt really know how she‚Äôd be around cats, so we took a few steps before they met. We also had plenty of time since she needed some immunizations and boosters so they couldn‚Äôt have met right away anyway. During that time we did a couple of room swaps for all three cats and tried feeding them by the door and rubbing towels on them to get scents and everything. That worked fine for the baby and the middle cat but the older former stray wouldn‚Äôt eat if the baby was nearby. She didn‚Äôt hiss, but refused food, which was odd since she‚Äôs usually very food motivated. When we moved on to introducing them through a screen, everything was mostly okay, too. The older cats just sort of hung out, watched the kitten run around, and the kitten showed very little interest in the older cats. 

Moving on to them being in the same room however? A disaster so far. The older stray has started hissing at everything. She hissed at the kitten at first, who would hiss back once in a while but mostly just ran off, and we did our best to discourage it. This has turned into the older stray hissing at us, the other cat, and just my bedroom door (where the kitten is) and almost constantly grumbling if she even gets a whiff of the kitten or hears her meow (which is often, she‚Äôs a very vocal kitten). 

I‚Äôm just unsure of what we‚Äôve done wrong. Any advice would be appreciated. Should we just go back to square one and try reintroducing? Would that work, or should we just let them work it out? It seems letting them is a bad plan, but we don‚Äôt really have a plan at all as of yet.

With the help of a neighbor we began leaving food out to try and catch and neuter them. Two are still feral and very skittish of people. The third began living under a wood pile in the yard, and we were able to socialize her and spay her in January. I adopted her and she seems to have taken to indoor life very well, though she's still a little skittish of being held.

The only problem we have had is that she shows little interest in using scratch boards or scratch posts. When she was still being socialized, I would see her scratch logs and a tree frequently in the yard, so I bought several cardboard scratch boards and a scratch post before bringing her inside. We initially kept her in the bathroom, which has tile, with a scratch board ans a small scratch pole, which never showed signs of being used while in there. When I moved her to my bedroom, she almost immediately began scratching the carpet. I've tried placing the scratch boards in the spots she scratches, and she then begins scratching right next to the boards. She especially loves scratching the legs of my wooden desk, and continues to do so even after I moved the scratch post next to it. I tried rubbing the scratch boards and scratch post with catnip, but she didn't scratch them at all, just rubbed them. 

She isn't completely uninterested in the scratch post, I have seen her grab it with her claws when she uses it to stretch.

The resident cat has been raised by my girlfriend since she was a kitten, and is an absolute soft sweetheart.  The only time this cat hisses, is when we try and get her in her carrier to go to the vet. Very laid back, and loves to interact with strangers.

The new cat is a sweet scared boy. He was an owner surrender at the pound.  He loves to climb over you and cuddle and lovesss being held. He's a scared boy and tends to run under the bed whenever there's a knock at our door. 

So what we've done so far to introduce these two. 

-We've been site swapping them. On day 1 we put the new boy into our spare bedroom, which is also my gf's office. We gave him his own litter box, and his own feeding bowls. We had our resident cat stay in our bedroom. 

-We put the pheromone spray dispense in the new cats room which really helped get him comfortable. The first 2 days he spent most of his time under the bed. 

-We set up their food bowls on both sides of the door

-On day 3 he was really comfortable around the room, and kept sniffing the door and trying to follow us out. So we let him walk around the hallway a bit. He started sniffing our bedroom door (where our resident cat is) and he stuck a paw under. He moved his paw and then our resident cat put her paw under and he touched it. Our resident cat started hissing, so he ran back into the room. 

-So later that day (We still had our resident cats litter box in the hallway), our resident cat started hissing at the office door (where the new cat is). So we moved her litter box into our room.

-To get our resident cat better adjusted to his scent, we rubbed towels on the new cat and placed it underneath our resident cats food bowls. At first he was hesitant and kept smelling them, but now he's eating with no issue with the scent.

-We site swapped them, and moved our resident into the office and our new cat into the bedroom.

-Our new cat has really opened up and gotten super comfortable.

-We got another pheromone dispenser, so we have one in both rooms, to help keep them calm.

-One thing we had seen as an idea was the baby gate. So we put up the baby gate at the door where they feed, and had it 98% covered by a blanket. When our resident cat saw his feet, she hissed. So we put away the gate and said we wouldn't try it for another week.

-We have them still feeding on opposite sides of the door, but we just have a towel stuffed in the crack of the door to avoid another paw situation.

Some background info- My cat Vincent is a 9 month old ragdoll that me and my boyfriend took home about 3 weeks ago. When he first came to us he was (still is) super confident and did not take much time to adapt. We live in a pretty small apartment (one room) but he has plenty of vertical and horizontal space to roam and doesn't get bored often.

We thought it would be great to give him access to our balcony since our apartment is pretty small and it is usually recommended by everyone online. So three days ago we cat proofed our balcony (nets and everything) and decided to let him out under supervision at five in the afternoon every day. Yesterday was the first day he was allowed to roam the balcony freely and after maybe five minutes he was zooming in and out of the balcony. During this zoomie he's pupils were dilated and he occasionally stopped and growled (not directly directed towards anything, but he did however make extended eye contact with me before growling). He has gotten zoomies in the past where he has growled but not to this extent. The zoomie lasted for maybe three minutes before we could distract him with a laser pointer and close the balcony door. After that he was his regular sweet self.

Today we let him out on the balcony again, just to see if the result would be different from the previous attempt. It started off well but he was soon back to getting zoomies in and out of the balcony. This time he flew up into his cat tree and locked eyes with me, followed by growling and hissing while still focused at me. I walked away and distracted him and just like last time he was back to his regular self within minutes. This is the first time he has hissed at me or anyone to my knowledge.

We are thinking that he's getting over stimulated since he's not used to the outdoors, but we are unsure if we should continue giving him balcony time in the future. I would love to hear if someone has had a similar experience and how/if you managed to solve it. Or if you just have some input on whether we should keep going with balcony time or not.

My cat is male and about a year and a half old. We‚Äôve lived in 3 apartments so far, and about to move again. The current apartment we‚Äôve been in for a year. 

When he was under a year old, in our first place which was 2 floors and rather large, he would occasionally pee in the corners of my bedroom, even though his litter box was in the same room. He would also pee in the box, but occasionally did not. 
I moved in with my boyfriend in March 2020, and we never had a problem with him peeing on the floor there. It was a small, one bedroom apartment. 
In May 2020, we moved across the hall to a slightly bigger one bedroom. At first there wasn‚Äôt a problem with him peeing outside of the litter box, though starting a couple months later he would occasionally pee on clothes if my boyfriend or I left anything on the ground. Then it moved to the corners in front of the bed, and picked up to be an weekly occurrence, and now it seems like it‚Äôs happening everyday. 
I‚Äôm a teacher, and due to the pandemic I was at home full time from March to around September and have slowly moved to being back at school 5 days a week. 
During the summer, I would have a friend check in on him if I spent a day at the beach or we left town. I always noticed the first night back, he would pee somewhere out of spite it seemed. Now that I‚Äôm not home as often, it seems like the same or a similar situation. 
Each time he pees somewhere I use an enzyme cleaner, we put him in his box if we catch him in the act, and at this point we‚Äôve had to resort to just not letting him in the bedroom which breaks my heart. 
We‚Äôre moving to a new apartment with two bedrooms in a month, and I want to prevent this from happening there. 
While I believe it‚Äôs a separation anxiety thing, i‚Äôm open to other causes of this.

So here's the sitch.

My cat is a 2-year-old little prince, and my absolute pride and joy. I've had him since he was a kitten, and he's always lived indoors, but I've been leash training him so he could still get the outdoor time and fresh air. At first he was absolutely TERRIFIED of going outside, would just cling to me with ALL the claws out until I took him back inside. But we took it slow, and he started to really enjoy exploring around my apartment complex and being outside in general.

So here's the present issue. I recently had to move to a much smaller apartment than he has ever experienced. I used to live with a roommate in a two-story apartment, where we also would periodically foster kittens. He's always had a big home and lots of interaction with other people and other cats. He's a social boy. But now it's just me and him in a studio apartment, and he's been getting bored and very anxious.

The main issue is that his fear of going outside has come back again, but ONLY SOMETIMES. When I want to take him out, he's suddenly scrambling to get back inside at all costs. But then an hour later, he is crying nonstop at the door and trying to get out. But I don't want to take him out THEN, because that would just reinforce more screaming whenever he wants to take a walk. He has never been the kind of cat that's tried to make a break for it, but since moving he's suddenly trying to get out whenever I open the door.

I absolutely don't want him getting out and running off without being on the harness. I live in a city area that is just not safe for a housecat to go roaming in. He's really well-behaved with other behaviors I've had to curb, and will know that a snap means ""stop what you are doing, that's not allowed."" But idk how to make him understand that it's only the being outside WITHOUT ME that I'm punishing, not being outside at all. I'm scared that I might accidentally just reinforce his random terror at going outside when I DO want him to.

Any advice? He's my pride and joy and I love him so much but he's been a little shit since we moved and I really don't want to instill a lasting bad behavior in him. :/",CatTraining,How to balance harness training with preventing prison break.

I‚Äôve had my cat Maxwell for 5 years now. I got him as a kitten from a shelter. He was a very sweet, snuggly boy. Never aggressive. Never once hissed at me or tried to swat or bite unless he just got a bit carried away playing, as cats do, but never anything angry or intentional.  

Anyway, in May 2020 I moved myself and Maxwell from my apartment (where he had always lived) into my then boyfriends home. Maxwell was unhappy to say the least for a few days and then as he got more comfortable he was happy as a clam in his new home. He was very friendly and affectionate with the boyfriend and myself. Fast forward to November of 2020, completely unsolicited as far as i could tell, i woke up one morning and maxwell started hissing and growling at me. I have no idea why. It seemed completely out of the blue, he was literally purring and rubbing on my leg and then it was like a flip switched and i was horrifying some how to him. This behavior has now continued on and off since then. I will walk into a room and he‚Äôll see me and hiss, growl and run off. He‚Äôll walk to up me purring and happy, look at me, hiss and arch his back and again run away. The house we were living in was an old house, there were mice, which he did catch a few of, and there were alley cats that would hang out on the porch.  Maxwell was never allowed outside but I thought maybe the combination of those smells was overwhelming for him and somehow he decided to take that out on me. I should point out, he never once hissed at the boyfriend. It was only ever at me.  The bf could walk into the room and max would be fine and i could walk in literally right after him and all hell would break lose. 

Said boyfriend and I break up, i move maxwell and myself into our own place.  i assume things will be better with less stimulation. he was eager to explore the first few days here and so happy with lots of purring and snuggles and no hissing.  i was feeling very hopeful! but then again, it started back up. to the point it is almost constant and it‚Äôs unbearable for me. i walk into a room and he loses his shit and runs to the opposite end of the apartment screaming his kitty head off and we have to play this game all day long as i go back and forth doing chores around the place. I cannot enter a room he is in without the aggressive behavior. 

I of course took him to the vet. physical exam and blood work were fine. he was a perfect angel for them.  No issues with eating. No issues with using his litter box. Ignoring him during these episodes doesn‚Äôt help. Giving him extra treats when he‚Äôs being nice and snuggling for positive reinforcement doesn‚Äôt help.

Well, Coconut had to go to the vet two days ago (very minor, she is fine). Because I was worried about this very thing happening, I rubbed both cats with a small towel before heading to the vet. I rubbed Coconut with the towel after the appointment but when I let her out of her carrier, Taro hissed at her and sprinted to hide under the bed. 

Taro is a very sensitive emotional cat in general and this has happened before. It has been 2 days and Taro is still hissing at Coconut, she won‚Äôt eat except nibbling at her food, and keeps walking around hissing at nothing and panting with her mouth open.

Last year, before lockdown was a thing, I adopted a rescue cat from Cats Protection League. They were having trouble rehoming him because he wasn't very friendly. He's a Bengal/Ragdoll Cross. His owners had only had Ragdolls and they had two kids who were getting bitten and scratched by the cat. But - he was good with dogs (I have 2) and good with horses (I live on an Equestrian Farm.) I don't have kids so thought let's give him a home! I went back to collect him, I signed the forms and they put him in the cat basket. Then they showed me the collar he'd been wearing when he was brought in by the original owners. It had about 5 large bells on it. It was heavy. They told me that the owner did not like that he brought prey home. To be honest, I thought it was cruel and stupid to think that a cat wouldn't bring things in - it's their nature.

So yes, he does bring prey in - more than any other cat I've had. Mostly he eats them. 

Two recent events:

1. Four mice with no heads - laid out in the kitchen. Side by side. Really neatly laid out. No blood.
2. Two small rabbits - one I rescued and took the local wildlife centre. The next day I woke up and there was a rabbit outside my bedroom door with its head removed and its two front paws removed. The head and paws were there next to the body. It looked they'd been chopped off.

I've never had a cat like this. It's taken him a year to not be scratchy and bitey. He will now sit on my lap. He cuddles and sleeps next to the dogs. But - and I know this is STUPID -  I can't help but think he's blimmin' evil or a psychopath!

I have an 11 month old male cat, and a 4 month old female puppy. The puppy has lived with us for maybe 3 weeks or so now, and they've never had unsupervised access to each other. That said there WERE some incidents where things got a little out of control very quickly. 

To the main issue, the cat likes to pick on the puppy and harrass her when he's bored. He will run up to her and bat (claws retracted), hiss, run around her play area to try and instigate a chase.  Sometimes it seems like play, but if the puppy actually engages with any of this behavior cat freaks out and acts like the victim/moves on to more aggressive growling.  

The puppy is, well, a puppy. Currently a ball of exuberance armed with needle sharp teeth.  We've made some progress with teaching her to ignore the cat but it doesn't seem fair when that cat is going out of his way to swat at her. 

Things we've tried: 
Cat gets playtime about 2-3 times a day, with lots of treats, training, and snuggles in-between.

 Cat does know, ""leave it"" when applied to treats but seems to ignore the command when it has to do with puppy or at least very reluctant to listen. 

Other notes: 
Cat seems to be indifferent to the dog I'd say most of the time. Acting out is mostly around times where he's bored.

I got each of my cats one at a time and have followed the standard introduction practices and all 3 get along great now. But with my new friend, an 8 year old male, I think I made a big mistake.

 I've been keeping him downstairs while the rest of the cats are upstairs but yesterday I let him walk around upstairs without securing the other cats. At different points they all saw one another and were hissing/growling at each other. My oldest cat seemed unbothered by him and left him alone when he hissed but the other 2 were very scared/defensive. He was also quite agressive with them. 

I brought him back downstairs (and since I've had him I've spent most of my time down there with him) but he just sat at the top of the stairs meowing/almost yowling as loud as he could. I couldn't distract him with anything. This went on all night. All day today too. Downstairs he has 2 beds, a cat tower, toys, his food/water and his litter box. He'd been perfectly fine down there before I let him go up. So...I felt really bad and let him upstairs again today. I let him out on our screened in porch and sat with him. He again saw the other cats through the screen. I brought him in and he walked around the living room a little and ended up spraying on the wall. When I brought him back downstairs, he would not leave the top of the stairs. Same meows/yowls. And I'm 100% sure that the only reason he's so worked up is because he wants to go upstairs. When he's upstairs he's perfectly relaxed, he'll lay down and chill out on the couch or something. But my issue is obviously him interacting with the other cats. 

He was an outdoor cat in his previous home and contracted FIV in a cat fight not too long ago. This is another reason I'm so worried about this introduction process because one solid bite could pass it on to another cat. And apparently he was very beaten up after the fight, which I'm sure contributes to his hostility towards other felines. So after all that info, how the hell should I approach this moving forward? Today when I allowed him to go upstairs I secured the other cats downstairs. I let him explore upstairs for almost 3 hours and he was totally cool until I brought him back down at night (around 9:30pm). It's currently 3:45AM and I could hear him from my 3rd story bedroom. I'm currently downstairs with him trying to pet him and help him relax but he just keeps running back to the top of the stairs and meowing as loud as he can, batting his paws under the door. I want him to be comfortable and happy but obviously I can't let him have free reign all day and night. I also don't think its fair to keep my other 3 cats downstairs and let him stay upstairs 24/7 by himself. But it seems even if he does get to go up for a good amount of time it's not enough. I don't know how long the introduction process will take until it's complete and they obviously need to stay separate until then. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do here???

Here's some details about our cats:

Names: Vinny and Sal Pesto (the Pesto Brothers)  
Breed: assumed Bombay by the vet and the descriptions of them are accurate.  
Age: approaching 2 years  
Adoption age: 8ish weeks.  
Background before adoption: Not known, but they were found abandoned in WV before making their way to the shelter. Both cats are voracious about food. They will eat anything and eat it as fast as they can. We have slow feeders and such, but when it comes time to feed them, they've always kinda batted each other and tried to box the other out from food.

Description of issues:  
Both cats have similar personalities (active, follow us around, curious, like to go outside). For the first 1.5 years of their life, they were very affectionate. Lots of cuddling together, grooming, wrestling, and playing.

About a year ago, Sal was getting very agitated because he saw a cat outside a ground-level window. Full standing hair halloween cat. I didn't think a ton of it at the time, but over the next 6 months, those cats would come around and eventually Sal redirected his aggression onto Vinny. It clearly soured their relationship because after that, when Vinny tried to play, Sal would get scared and react aggressively. And when Sal would recover and try to play, then Vinny didn't trust him and would react. Then it got to the point where Vinny would initiate the aggression by pouncing on Sal and biting his back.

We did the full separation and slow reintroduction earlier this year. That seems to stop the worst of the aggression. But they don't cuddle, rarely groom each other, and still get pretty testy around food (and sometimes human attention).

In my reading, it seems like around 2, cats start to figure out there's a hierarchy in the world and they battle for it (we have a dog so they're pretty much battling to just not be in last place). Is this just a case of our cats are growing up and they've grown out of their youthful friendship or is this still lingering effects from the redirected aggression and should we revisit separation and reintroduction?",CatTraining,2-year-old Bombay brothers more distant with each other; normal growing up or lingering effect from redirected aggression?

CreepyPancakes,1615886977,m654lp,2,False,1,"Hi, /r/CatTraining!

First off: I've been lurking around this sub since January, and want to thank you all for all the good advice, insight and tricks I've found in numerous other threads. The other corners of the internet that provide guidance on these topics can often be contradictory or confusing, so it's good to hear directly from pet owners with firsthand experience.

Anyway, a little background: Me and my partner adopted two female kittens from the same litter back in January, named Namo and Truffle. We love'em both to death - they're both really good with people and super cuddly, and they get along famously with each other (playing, exploring and often sleeping together). They're also pretty smart, and took to clicker training quickly. They'll be 4 months old next week.

Now, our bedroom is off-limits to the kittens for a number of reasons. This hasn't been a problem before - the kittens would always happily do their final 11 pm 'zoomies', go to sleep in their towers in the living room, and would greet us happily the next morning when we got up at around 9 am.

But then, a little over a week ago, Truffle started showing up outside our bedroom door at ~6-6:30 am, ~~screaming~~ meowing bloody murder and furiously shredding the bedroom doorpost in order to wake us up and get us out into the living room. She has also done it at 4 am at least twice. We can't figure out why she suddenly started doing this. Now, thanks to the internet and multiple cat-owning friends, I know the drill: ignore it and don't open the door or acknowledge her in any way, so as not to reinforce the behavior (it's abundantly clear that it's attention/company she wants). Unfortunately, there are a few complications; first off, I'm a heavy sleeper and can sometimes sleep right through this ruckus, leaving my partner to listen to never-ending shrill meowing and the doorpost being destroyed, which keeps him awake (during a period when he desperately needs his sleep to perform at work). Unfortunately, this has led to him caving at least twice, and going out to sleep the rest of the morning in the living room (without feeding or playing with the cats until 9 am, though). Secondly, my partner is diabetic, and sometimes **has to** leave the bedroom at night or early in the morning in order to regulate his blood sugar. He also can't sleep with ear plugs, so that isn't a solution for him. Truffle will also often keep this up until, or start again right before, we actually need to get up. We still try to wait until she's stopped to leave the bedroom, but it's a short window before she starts again, so we can't wait too long, meaning she definitely thinks she's gotten her way through that behavior.

I've tried covering the doorpost and door in aluminum foil and no-scratch spray, and leaving quartered lemons on the doorsep, to no avail. The spray deters Truffle for 5 minutes at most, which doesn't help when my only chance to spray is before bedtime. The lemons she'll just bat away. The other cat (Namo), who mostly leaves us alone at night and in the morning, is also so kind as to almost surgically remove the aluminum foil to enable Truffle to do her thing. At this point, I'm starting to seriously consider getting one of those things that shoots out a stream of compressed air when the cat gets close, but 1. I would rather not scare Truffle and make her more anxious (she's already more insecure than her sister), and 2. The thing costs upwards of $160 in my country

My cats essentially beeline to piss or poop in my beds. They have enough litter boxes. This is recent behaviour, no major life changes.

I change litter daily. I play with them daily. Diet unchanged. No health problems. I have had them each for five years.

I can't imagine why they absolutely fucking *insist* on using my beds as litter boxes. 

It is disgusting. A pile of poop or pee, without fail, if I let them in a room unsupervised. I've gone so far as to put straight bleach on the messes, which just makes them pick a new spot. Almost every single day for the last month they have been peeing or pooping on one of my beds.

CometTrail,1615860000,m5yc64,2,False,1,"Hey all! I have an interesting training question for you folks. TLDR at the bottom.

Our 2 year old cat recently moved with us into a 2bed condo. We were previously in a one bed w/ a patio, but our cat never really liked using it, or at least wouldn‚Äôt meow to go outside. We would allow her to step outside when she was near the door, but she would get frightened and run back in quickly. It was rare for her to even stand by the door.

Now that we are in a 2bed without a patio we decided to buy her a harness so she could at least have some safe outside time. However here‚Äôs the catch: now she is meowing by the door constantly to go outside. 

I don‚Äôt want to teach her that meowing near the door is wrong necessarily, since she‚Äôs just verbally communicating a desire and we have the means to bring her outside. However we want to teach her that meowing near the door for hours on end isn‚Äôt the best lol.

Currently when she meows we try either bring her out for a bit, or if it‚Äôs night/raining/etc we will try distracting her with pets and toys. This however only works for a second as she‚Äôs normally back by the door as soon as playtime is over. (She gets a pretty good amount of playtime a day, at least an hour or so not counting her playing w toys by herself)

TLDR: How do we teach our 2y/o cat that constantly meowing near the door is a no-no, but meowing occasionally when she wants out is ok? Is this possible or do we need to think about this in a new way entirely?

The setting: small 2 bedroom condo

The culprits:

3 cats. Dexter is mine, he‚Äôs 11 and I‚Äôve had him since he was a baby. The other too, came with my girlfriend when she moved in with me in October. They are mother and son: Ginger and Fatty are roughly the same age give or take a few years. 

The issue: 
Ginger wants to kill Dexter.  She is super sweet to humans. We keep the two ginger cats separated from him almost 100% of the time but any time we slip up she will go insane, sneak through the door, and immediately dodge at him and attack. She is obsessed with trying to murder him and she‚Äôs a really good escape artist so it‚Äôs not an easy feat to keep them safe from each other. Fatty and Dexter can be in the same room for short periods but Fatty is really curious and sneaks up on Dexter which usually ends with them fighting and having to be separated. Dexter is semi-socialized and has been around other cats relatively fine (for instance my mom‚Äôs 3 cats) but he‚Äôs absolutely terrified of these two. The other day I was holding him, which he‚Äôs usually fine with, when my girlfriend was moving Ginger from one room to another and he attacked me pretty brutally and abruptly to the point where I was bruised and bleeding. I don‚Äôt blame him for this but it‚Äôs becoming unsustainable to live like this. It might be worth mentioning that Dexter sleeps with us at night (he is needy and doesn‚Äôt let me sleep away from him) and the other cats sleep in the other room. Our goal is for them all to get along enough to sleep where they want in the house but I wonder if this is causing jealousy.

What we‚Äôve tried:
We‚Äôve tried putting them in crates and slowly moving them closer. Ginger goes crazy and attacks the sides of the crates trying to get at Dexter, which I feel like is just traumatizing him and not making any progress. Dexter howls and cries.

We‚Äôve tried gates between the doors. Ginger charges at the gate, which is more or less fine but doesn‚Äôt really seem to be progressing anything. We‚Äôve been exposing them through the gates for months.

I'd appreciate any bits of information and good sources on the topic - socializing a scared cat.

I got a cat rescued from streets 5 days ago. She's been to vet, sterilized, checked and all. She's around 2 or 3 years old.

I believe she had had a home at some point of her life, because she had used provided litter box at least once while being with me and reportedly had been using it at rescue volunteer's. She also meows, though only when really stressed, and purrs.

The issue is, she's scared to death of people and hands, she seems to be not motivated by food, though it could be just her fear of hands (no, plastic spoon doesn't help either). When I took her on my lap today, she purred while I was scratching her neck. But the moment she sees my hand she freezes, stiffens, stops purring. She's also ready to flee any moment and she does so the moment she realizes she's not being held. She is not aggressive at all.

She eats well and drinks water at night, exploring the room and furniture. Me and my roommates work from home in the same room where she hides (we made her a cat house from a cardboard box to hide in and placed it in the corner so she could see us from there. She seems to be comfortable there, sleeping, relaxed). We use quiet music and radio to help her to overcome her fears. The first day she was alone in another room hiding under a bed.

She won't show up from her hiding place unless it's night and everybody sleeps. We believe it's going to be a self-sustaining cycle of her living at night and hiding for the whole day, so that's why with permission of her rescue volunteers I started petting her on my lap today. I know it might be not a good idea to get the cat out of her hiding place, but is it really different from using a cage and getting a cat out of it 6-8 times a day like some methods suggest?

Nundi-,1614766785,lwql8j,12,False,3,"Hi everyone! 

One year ago i adopted a 2,5 year old cat from Greece (we live in The Netherlands). He seems to have been abused before he got to the shelter in Greece and is sometimes still scared. Over the year he has been with us he has become much more trusting and less scared. 
One big issue is that he is absolutely terrified of the cat carrier and will not go in it. Once a year we have to go to the vet for vaccinations and a check up, and lets just say last year was a disaster. He got calming meds from the vet and ended up covered in puke an diarrhea. 
In about 4 months it is time to go again and we don‚Äôt want to medicate him again and force him in the carrier. Therefore we have been harnas training him. 

Now he will wear the harnas without freaking out and will just wander around the house in it. This has taken a couple weeks. However, as soon as he sees the leash that is to be attached, he freaks out and hides. 
Today we managed to get the leash on and he stayed calm right up to the point where i held the leash, he sprinted backwards so fast he even took the harnas off. 

What do we do now? Do we keep trying to get him used to the leash? Do we have to buy a different harnas and start over considering he managed to escape this one in a second when he ran backwards? 

Any recommendations about a good harnas are welcome.

Partly due to me being gone for part of the summer, and partly due to starting introductions more quickly than I should have, plus the fact he‚Äôs an escape artist, I‚Äôve had to back off completely and restart introductions several times.  This last attempt, beginning in December , has been going quite well.  Resident cat really doesn‚Äôt want the intruder in her house, but she‚Äôs mellowing.  Pandemic cat is scared of her - not terrified, but hisses and runs away occasionally. I‚Äôve slowly been lowering the barrier between them and making it more transparent- now it‚Äôs just a pet gate about 18 inches high.  I‚Äôm almost to the point of removing it altogether- they‚Äôll both happily get treats (their jackpot treat) or food about 18-24 inches (half a meter) from the gate, no hissing, all staring can easily be distracted by a treat, and when either one is done, they look confident walking off.  Today, resident cat decided she was done after a training session and walked off.  I was standing in the doorway, one foot on each side of the pet gate.  Pandemic cat looked very curious- like ‚Äúwhere did she go?‚Äù - and leapt over the barrier into the room where she is.  There were a couple hisses, he ran behind the sofa in that room.  She got into a cat tunnel in the room, so I picked up the ends so she wouldn‚Äôt go on the attack - she growled before she went in there, but she didn‚Äôt complain at all after.  He bailed out as soon as he realized I was  standing in the middle of the room., saying ‚Äúwhat did you do?‚Äù No harm but a few hisses.  

Any clue what he‚Äôs thinking so that when I get them back to this step - or the next one - he doesn‚Äôt rush her again?  It‚Äôs very odd because she‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs usually aggressive- and he didn‚Äôt look aggressive at all before he did it, just curious.  He‚Äôs done similar things twice before, earlier in the process- in both cases, I could get them back to the exact step in the process pretty quickly.

All is going well except for when I put him up at night or when I go somewhere like work or school.  My hope is to eventually not have him locked in that room and just let him have free reign over walking around.  But for now I‚Äôm trying to train him to understand what he can and can‚Äôt do around my apartment.

I‚Äôve tried just shy of everything to keep him from scratching to be let out.  Double sided tape, aluminum foil, citrus smells, and most recently a blockade to slide under the door that I made.  The blockade has worked fairly well so far but when I came home from work today I noticed that he somehow stuck his claws in the small crevice that‚Äôs left between the doorway and the door when it‚Äôs closed.  I thought I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it because of how small the space is but he somehow reached in there and started peeling the wall.

Mahoushi,1613723879,lnb1dw,13,False,1,"It's depressing, stressful, and exhausting. I have PTSD from something unrelated but one of the things is heightened anxiety, the stuff he does has been affecting me a lot. I visited my sister a while ago and someone knocked a cup onto the floor and it startled me and made my heart skip a beat when I heard it land on their carpet, nothing broke but it deeply affected me. I never used to react that way to stuff being knocked over.

He seems to act up when I've not paid attention to him for too long (in his eyes) or I'm sleeping. Mostly when I'm sleeping.

The biggest thing is him knocking things over. What's worse is I have insomnia since before I had him (part of the ptsd) so I have trouble with sleeping as it is. This doesn't help and just puts me in a bad mood and makes me too tired to do anything the following day, including stuff he wants from me like playing.

He knows he shouldn't do this because he flees and hides as soon as he hears me get out of bed to investigate. I try not to investigate unless it sounds like he knocked over something that broke, because I read that it teaches him that it works and to do it whenever he wants to call me over.

When I go through periods of being a heavy sleeper, I hate waking up and discovering he's trashed the place. It's exhausting and upsetting cleaning everything up first thing in the morning every day. The things he messes up tends to be books on my bookshelf and a tea light holder I have, and whatever else. Last night it was some clothes on the radiator.

He can start up between 1am and 6am.

I have another cat who's very well behaved but doesn't seem like adequate company for this one, he always wants my attention and nothing else is good enough.

He did nearly die at 6 weeks old and had to stay at a vet for a week back then, but he's 2 years old now and I've noticed this demanding behaviour just getting worse. I know it sounds bad but when he's being particularly awful and it's daytime, I have to grab my camera and go for a walk down by the river and taking photos to calm myself down and give myself a break.
I really resent him sometimes, I don't understand why he does these things when he knows he shouldn't, when he seems to understand how unhappy it makes me. I've just sat down in the middle of my trashed up living room once crying and he came over and tried patting my face, it was cute but if he could just not do that shit to our home, that'd be better.

Overall he is lovely and gentle, and he's my family. I don't want him gone I just want to know if there's anything I can do to make him stop doing this.

I've tried playing with him more because I read that it can be from boredom, but he starts up again as soon as I stop and sometimes I'm playing with him until he's panting like a dog! I also have a cat tower, cat toys, and he loves playing with sticks and bouncy balls, so I've got him all that stuff but nothing is suitable unless I'm playing with him and I can't be doing that 24/7, I have my own things to do. My other cat isn't nearly as demanding and sometimes I feel sorry for him, if I'm playing with the other cat, this one always gets jealous and interferes somehow, one time he came over and batted at the other cat's nose like he was doing something wrong by playing with me. Idk if it's important to mention but he is neutered, he's an indoor cat that hated going outside on the veranda as a test run with his harness on so I haven't tried since.

How awful he can be to the other cat doesn't stop there, sometimes he gobbled down his food really fast and tries to push away the other cat from his food and eat his, even when I monitor them and stop him from doing this, the other cat leaves his food anyway because he's put off even knowing this cat wants it. I can't feed them in separate rooms because they both just go to the door separating them and paw at it and won't eat anything until they're reunited.

The other cat is bigger and stronger than he is (they are the same age, just different breeds), so when he does finally piss him off, it doesn't usually go well for him. I only intervene when it looks like their scuffles are getting really intense cos I read sometimes its playing or they need to work it out. They do bundle together and sleep together and bathe each other as well, so it seems like my other cat is kind of like me with him, he's a pain but we love him.

Sorry about the tangent, I felt it might give you a better idea of what he can be like not just to me, but to his cat friend. Thanks for reading and please tell me if there's anything I can do about this.",CatTraining,Cat Knocking Stuff Over &amp; Being Loud at Night

She *always* poops beside it or near it but we keep it in our unfinished basement, so whatever. Peeing, other than in her litter box, has never been an issue.

We have a pretty small house and 5 of us, so I‚Äôve recently moved my bed into the basement so my daughter could have her own room. The basement is where the cat spends most of her time and I‚Äôm in Canada, it gets chilly enough in our basement so you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd be cool with just snuggling in my bed all day right?

CaptainAsleep,1613679606,lmw6bs,3,False,1,"I‚Äôve always been a dog person but when we moved into our new house I adopted two cats for my barn from our local a working cat program when I learned about the program. So I‚Äôm familiar with feral/barn cat behavior and schedules. Last spring, I adopted two additional cats for the barn. The young siamese male did not seem feral or human avoidant. After observation I realized the only reason he was put in the working program was because he hissed when I approached him. But this was because his eyes were shaking back and forth! He could not see clearly! 

I transitioned him indoors and basically did the barn cat transition but in our kitchen and he slowly came out of his shell. Fast forward to today and he is the most lovable playful stinker. He has stolen our hearts and makes us laugh so much. He is not cuddly and we cannot pick him up but he‚Äôs our bestie for life. 

My goal has been to transition his litter box out of our dining room and into the basement. We cut a cat door into the basement door and I thought all cats loved basements. I was pretty sure he‚Äôd disappear for a few days. He won‚Äôt go near it. 

The past week I have been trying to persuade him with treats to come through the hole and eat a treat off the top step. Which he will do but he grabs the treat and runs back out of the hole in a panic to eat the treat. Once he‚Äôs used to that top step, I‚Äôve tried moving down to the next and he won‚Äôt budge. I‚Äôve even tried using bacon instead of cat treats.

The basement steps are old wooden steps that creak and you can see through the steps. If we changed them out and carpeted them, would it make a difference? I‚Äôd hate to do all that and it not help at all.  I realize this probably has something to do with his vision.

I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice on this issue because I‚Äôm at my wits end! I recently moved into a studio apartment with my 9 month old female cat (spayed).

I cleaned it out as best I could in the tub and left it hanging to dry for a few days, during which she went back to peeing in the box. 

I just put the mat back under her litter box today and, what do you know. Giant puddle of urine.

Backstory: my wife and I adopted a kitten from the farm where she boards her horse. The cats aren't necessarily feral because they have had a very large amount of contact with humans.

At the time I was told she was just turning 8 weeks old and was eating kibble along with the rest of the litter they had. The kittens all seemed healthy, active, and were playing well with the other cats in the household. Sagira (what we ended up calling her) is absolutely adorable and gets along well with my approximately 8 month old rescue that we got around the same time. She handles her own with the older more territorial cats in the house as well as the 90lb goof of a dog we have. The one issue we've had with her is that at mealtimes, she. Goes. Nuts. She gets fed 3 times a day, kitten wet food mixed with kitten formula because I noticed she was a little underweight for an 8 week old. Just over a lb when I brought her home. Now at nearly 4 months old she is just over 2 lbs. Aside from not gaining much weight and her abnormal highly neurotic behavior at mealtimes she is your standard kitten. Wants to play all day, chases the dog's tail, climbs all over the bookshelves, etc. At mealtimes she becomes single mindedly focused on inhaling all food within sight and it usually takes about an hour to calm her back down, even after she's eaten all her food she scrounges around looking for more with her belly swollen from how full she is. She is noticably thinner in between meals, and lighter. We're having trouble getting her in for her first shots because our vet is booked out due to a backlog of patients from the pandemic.

ConfusedFlareon,1612336545,lbi4z6,8,False,1,"Hey all! Pretty much all summed up in the title :)

I have a four month old Russian girl who's lived with me around two months now. She is fixed, she came home at 12 weeks and her breeder was absolutely wonderful so she's had the perfect start to life. She's also very very smart and enjoys purposefully flaunting the (very few, I might say!) rules when bored or unimpressed.

So far, teaching her the rules and basic training has been pretty straight forward, she picks things up very quickly and techniques like totally ignoring (to teach her she can't have our dinners) or pushing away with a firm No (to teach her she can't walk on our laptops) work well.

I'd love to teach her more though - she's definitely smart enough for tricks, and she still gets bored even with interactive toys and good big playtimes.

But - she has literally zero interest in any kinds of treats. I have tried crunchy 'milky' treats, crunchy meaty with soft inside, softer meaty, crunchy meaty, smooshy tube, boiled chicken... she just does not care. Which means giving her one of those kong toys or puzzle toys is pointless coz she has no interest in the the treat!

Hi there! I have a a few cat training questions lining up, so I'll probably be making more posts soon, but today's events made one question more...immediate.

**Question:** Is it possible to train a cat to kill the mice he catches?

**Background**: Juniper the cat is 16 months old, adopted at about 6 months old. We've done some basic training - 'come here', 'sit' etc. He loves to play hunting games, chasing and catching toys, biting them, giving them the tooth-and-claw 'hug of death'. Ever since he first saw a mouse in the house, he'd spend hours with eyes glued to the spot he saw it. Eventually, he caught one, and he's caught a few more since then. This is great! We clearly have pest issues. So what's the problem?

**The problem**: He catches them, but does not kill them. He just plays and plays with the poor thing, ever so gently...it's almost cute, but the mouse is definitely not having fun as much fun as he is. :(

Makes sense, I suppose - he's a well fed fur baby, doesn't need to supplement his diet, and from what I've read on the internet this isn't uncommon. But since he doesn't kill them, I have to, and I do not love this situation! Also one has got away (this is what happened today) - so it's not the most effective on the pest control front.

It's curious because with his toys he bites down hard and gives them a shake, which is classic hunting kill behaviour, but he never does this with real mice (he also never bites hard on people, though he does sometimes nibble fingers for attention. Related? Idk.).

Any clues as to why this might be? And does anyone know if it's possible to teach him to finish the job?

Sorry if this is a bit distasteful, but it would really help to have some insight. Thanks in advance.",CatTraining,Mouser training - any tips?

JSalamander23,1612198058,la7n61,53,False,23,"My two cats are about 4 years old and I have always given them wet food twice a day in the morning and the evening. One of my cats has always been a persistent whiner if he wants anything be it attention or food, and in the morning he waits outside my bedroom door and with increasing urgency and volume meows starting sometimes around 5-6 am. When I open the door he chirps and yowls excitedly and follows me around relentlessly until I feed him. 

I've tried to be vigilant about always feeding him after I've done a few things like used the bathroom and making myself tea but also realize that there are days when I'm in a rush to leave the house and have to feed him immediately which creates inconsistency and probably just reinforces his idea that he can \*get\* me to feed him if he just complains loudly enough. I have tried positioning a motion detecting air spritzer outside my bedroom door but he is so determined he just runs past it or sits just beyond its reach and howls louder. I sleep with my door closed and a fan running and earplugs in but I have insomnia and his meowing will penetrate all that and wake me up. Ultimately I would like to find a way to have my peace in the morning and would also like the ability to feed them reliably if I want to spend the night at my partner's house, so I've started trying an automatic feeder in the morning and just doing wet food at night

My issue about 4 days into this experiment is that while my cats enjoy crunching on kibble as a snack, they don't view it as a meal, so when the kibble dispenses they just go sniff at it and then continue staring at me and my one cat continues whining. Will this just get better with time if I stick with it? 

I feel bad about reducing their wet food to only once a day, it feels like compromising their health for some extra quiet in the morning, but I am tired of being a slave to these cats. Is there something else I can try that would redirect their attention to some other object? I've considered maybe having an alarm go off at, say, 7am every day and have that be the prompt they wait for when they know I will feed them, but as I mentioned, occasionally I have to leave early for my job and that would throw it off, and I don't think it's reasonable for me to feed them at 5 am every day in the name of consistency.

My wife and I are planning to move from Chiang Mai, Thailand to Savannah, GA in October / November of 2022. I'm thinking of this stuff way ahead of time so as not to cause undue stress in prepping for the relocation.   


We have two cats, both around a year old. We absolutely want to take them with us. It may seem a bit silly, but we did promise them they'd always be with us; we want to make good on that promise.   


Cat shipping seems like a horrendously stressful affair for them, but I can't find anything that *isn't* going to cause them some stress. I'll outline what I'd like to do in terms of just the transportation and I'd love it if you folks could give me some advice or, perhaps, point me to a subreddit that may be better equipped to answer the question, if that's the case.   


The plan is to get two first-class tickets for the flight. Having just a bit more room at our feet for their carrier and far fewer people to annoy could be a net-positive.  


We would transport them in two expandable cat carriers, then put them together once we're on the flight to maybe help with the stress (though the enclosed space may end up causing more stress).  


We'd use the second carrier as the sort of 'bathroom' and take them into the lavatory every couple of hours for this and for food / water.   


I also want to consider the concerns of other people in the first-class cabin; there may be cat allergies or the cats may start caterwauling hardcore.   


Once we get stateside and leave the airport, everything can be dealt with as we get to it (the fallout from their stress, hunger / dehydration from stress, etc.). I'm primarily concerned about the travelling impact on them as well as considerations for the other people onboard.   


So to recap, here are the broad points I'd like advice on.   


* Useful carriers for the airlines that would fit their standards
* Advice on how to handle the cats during layovers (up to 6 hours in some cases)
* Stress relief
* Passenger considerations
* Tactics for handling bodily functions / hygiene
* Would the first-class space actually make a difference (given the incurred additional cost)?
* Are there any reliable, caring, and kind providers for services like this (CNX to ATL) that could remove any human inconvenience (other passengers, not us) from the equation?

I'm really pleased that he seems to have learned ""sit"" as a trick. Before I set his food and water bowls down, I say ""sit"" and wait until he sits before putting the food down. I also get him to sit pretty quickly when I have a treat in my hand. 

I'm really looking forward to trying to teach him other tricks! However, one thing I've noticed is that he doesn't necessarily seem to understand ""sit"" as the cue to sit. I think his cue is that he sees food or a treat, hears me say something, and knows to sit. That's fine for now but I would love to get him to understand audio cues better. I also have a clicker that I click when he does a good action/right before throwing a treat over. However, he doesn't seem to associate the clicker sound with a cue. He moreso sees the clicker and associates the visual of it with ""ohh I might get a treat."" 

He doesn't respond to his name either. I'm currently trying to teach him to stop climbing and sitting on top of my instant pot. The idea is that when I see him on there, I want to be able to say ""come down"" to get him to jump off. The words don't seem to register for him, so I've added a visual cue of making a fist.

Imgoingtowingit,1611851936,l71otg,4,False,1,"**Story:** 

So we used to have two cats, brother and sister, and the sister got out and has been gone since. We live on the second floor and my wife's friend was house sitting and it ""jumped out the window"". Long story short after that trip we lost our cat and my wife lost a friend.

A few months later we got a puppy and the neutered cat started peeing everywhere. Marking the curtains, sofa, the perimeter of the house, one time my computer when given two seconds to do so. 

We have had the dog for about 2 years now and the cat has calmed down. The dog is very well trained. The cat and dog play a lot and they get along very well. The cat only pisses a couple of times a day in certain spots around the house. But it is still pretty bad. If we clean, he sprays. Sometimes he pisses and leaves a puddle. 

I am at my limit. Every time we come home the living room smells horrible. We may have to replace the couches at some point. I work from home and my wife works 6 days a week on location. She is pretty bad with training animals in general. When we got them they tore the bottoms of the sofas to climb in and hide. She did nothing. It is just me and the dog and cat at home most days.

He would meow constantly and she lavishes him with attention. So at 3 am he jumps on the bed and meows and meows and she praises him. Shit like that. I have been trying to get her to stop that and ignore him till he calms down and doesn't meow. It's been getting better lately. 

But she is very bad at being consistent with him. This is a demanding cat, obviously. I tell her to not feed him so much as he's getting fat but she rushes to fill his bowl when he whines. 

**What we have done:**

\- We try to play with him often  
\- Keep his litter bowl clean  
\- Tried using fellyway cat odor  
\- Close off door access or window  
\- Cover the couches when we leave  
\- Had a cat psychologist come and watch him for a few hours  
\- Cat is neutered we did a test if he had a phantom teste, nothing...

So now I have no clue what to do. He is a damn cat so he is not responding to negative attention. He keeps marking certain rooms or areas consistently and it's driving me bonkers.

Lightzeaka,1611782791,l6er5v,32,False,1,"Hi all! I have two cats, well I guess they're still Kittens. They are currently 9 months old, Pebble (black cat with white spots) and Grady (Siamese). They're both very sweet, we (girlfriend and I) got them when they were only a month old (abandoned by mom along with several other liters, most likely brothers).

As soon as they were able to walk around and jump, Grady got in to the sink and started eating leftover food in there. We eventually broke this habit by catching him while he was doing it and putting him under the running water in the sink. He hasn't gone up on the counter in the kitchen for MONTHS. Pebble never went up on the counter until a few months ago.

I've tried doing the same thing to Pebble as I did with Grady, and it isn't working. I've put him under the water and a mere hour later, he goes back for more! I try to keep the sink empty at all times, but I can't always do that.

I was pretty hard on him the other day and tried a new form of punishment - isolation. I'll take Pebble, but him in our shower (don't worry, water not running) since it's a standing tower with a sliding door and not a tub, and squirt him once or twice with the squirt bottle. He hates it and let's out a guttural whine when I do it, but he clearly isn't learning. I only punish him when I catch him on the counter or in the sink, and he knows he's not supposed to because he runs away after I see him doing it and tries to hide. However, typically after punishing him, he'll clean himself since he gets wet, and then goes back to being his cude, cuddly, LOUD PURRING self. (seriously, I just pick him up and he purrs like crazy).

However, today I noticed something really upsetting. I think he's scared of me after punishing him yesterday. When I walk past him, he'll run away a little and hide under the coffee table or behind my girlfriend. The onlyu reason I punish him is because he's already got in to the sink before and throw up because he ate food that is toxic to cats. I just want to break this habit, and this morning, he got back up on the counter and licked frosting off some cake my girlfriend made the previous night. He isn't learning, and now he's also afraid of me! I don't know what do to.

imthatguynamedwolf,1611655643,l5b3pu,3,False,1,"Hi, dog trainer here. I have three cats living outside, and they chase the crows that roam around the yard and street. I don't like them doing that, and I also think the crows are lovely.

Right now I have 3 cats, had 6. all male, one is two years old and the others are ten months old. All are brothers by same mom and they are close with eachother.

They are used to my dog (malinous) and they don't mind him at all(he's trained to be gentle around them). The dog is ok with everyone (including crows) but the cats are only ok with me and the dog.

One of the cats that disappeared was a serious hunter. She killed centepieds and crickets and even Draras, a green invasive parrot. the others always followed her. They would wait from 4 different bushes and try to kill birds, even sometimes attack other cats. They would never hunt without her, and she would sometimes do it alone. All from the yard/across the street. She would sometimes try to chase crows.

Now, the eldest cat became a hunter. He hides in tall grass and simulating hunt with his brothers, he ""practices"" stealth on me too (which didn't happen before), and he tries to kill crows and his brothers will try to follow him but not all the way. Only crows, even there are more of other smaller birds. I am concerned for him because the crows here are known (I've seen it myself) to revenge attacks, even on cats. Most cats here learn to respect crows and even stand close to another but my cats are stupid and try to kill them, but they never successful.

 I have tried to use methods of dog training on them and it worked to some point, but I don't have many experience with cats to know their behavior that well as I do with dogs. I can kinda call them on command, I can absolutely call them if I have treats. So I try to call them and feed them treats (yes I reduce it from their meals) while the crows are around, and it works only if the cats are very close to me. But if the cats are closer to the crows they'll chase after them.

Should I add a specific word, sound and/or visual gesture for when crows are around? What do you think would be ideal?

Also, I have thaught of making a bird doll modeled after the invasive birds here, and roping it to a rod and try to simulate hunt for him and try to channel that hunting instincts to a good cause. What do you think? I only think of this option because they are invasive species and have reduced the numbers of local birds by alot.",CatTraining,How do I stop my cats from chasing crows?

I have an 8 month old female Norwegian Forest Cat called Bryn. She was neutered mid December.  Indoor only.

Some days she is an absolute angel, affectionate and playful, will just lay with you watching the world go by.

But lately most days shes a demon. She does everything she knows she isnt allowed to do, it feels like all the training I have done with her has stopped working. She isnt allowed behind the tv because of all the wires back there (they are mostly covered with tubing but some arent like the internet cables) and she isnt allowed up on the kitchen counters when I'm cooking, but lately it's like that's all she wants to do. I've tried telling her off, removing her without speaking, spraying with water and ignoring her but it isnt working. If I ignore her she just seems pleased she can mess with the wires uninterrupted or walk around on the counters undisturbed.

I thought it was an attention thing, but last night I played and played with her with a feather wand for about 2 hours to try and get her to settle but every time I stopped moving the wand she ran behind the tv. I tried enticing her over for a cuddle but she would just come over, bite my hand and run behind the tv. Its almost like she wants me to get annoyed and chase her! When I was playing with her last night she was so tired she was just lying down panting and swiping at the wand if it was nearby, but as soon as I stopped moving it she would find the energy to dart behind the tv. When she is like this she wont let me touch her either, she just twists around and bites and scratches.
I ended up getting quite annoyed and left her downstairs to go to bed before I started to see red.

Sometimes putting her in my bedroom for 10 mins calms her down but then I feel guilty about that. 

She has so many toys, a floor to ceiling cat tree in 3 rooms plus scratching posts, cardboard scratchers and radiator shelves all over the house. So the house is definitely cattified. On a weekend if the weather is good I take her in the garden on a leash. I thought she was getting enough mental stimulation but it seems the toy she really wants is my nerves!

If I do let him in he will crawl over me and my computer and its impossible to get anything done.

* Is this cruel to him?

They told me she'd be cuddly and easy to train, but alas, nothing is ever easy as it seems.  She is extremely bitey.  We try to avoid patting unless she asks, and even then we keep it short, but sometimes she'll just run up and bite us.  She also uses biting to show frustration, for example after we remove her from places she shouldn't be or even when she is seeking attention. She has drawn blood literally everyday I've had her. For more context here is her general daily routine. 

Three meals a day at, morning evening and night.  We play with her about 30 minutes before meal time until she tires out and leaves or its meal time. 

If she does bite our current strategy is telling her no, and then ignore her or leave the room.   

We've also put double sided tape on surface she shouldn't be on, but she just walks between the gaps.  

We've also taken her to the vet, and they said she is healthy.

He misbehaves near constantly. November and December it was him constantly climbing the Christmas tree. The first half of January was him screaming all morning and evening... to the point where we couldn't sleep or work from home. Now he only screams occasionally but has a new VERY bad habit of climbing our flat screen TV. 

We've tried everything we can think of (and even tried our family and friends' suggestions). Saying ""No"" very clearly stops him for a second but then he goes right back to it. Spraying him with water doesn't stop him (he unfortunately loves water), removing him and distracting him with toys only works until we stop playing with him and then he instantly runs back to the TV.

morecheezplss,1611604445,l4vya5,0,False,1,"I'm looking for some advice. I am exhausted. My boyfriend and I have two cats, a female about 9 years old that I had prior to our relationship and a male, about 3-4 years old, who we adopted together about 3 years ago. 

Murray, the \~4-year-old male is the problem child. He is fixed and does not have any underlying health conditions. He will NOT let us sleep. We go to bed about 12:30a-1:30am and per previous advice, we wait to feed both cats until we go to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

By 3 am he is sitting on our bedside tables meowing and running from any surface he can get to. He also does this awesome thing with the blinds that make the most horrible noise. So, we close him out of the room. 

Now he begins the fun with scratching under the door, at the door, or at the door handle. We have wedged a towel under the door - he got that out. We tried the sticky tape that cats are supposed to hate - he didn't mind. We also try to barricade the door with hampers, totes, and anything that will block the door - but he manages to rearrange and use them as a jungle Jim to just scratch higher at the door. 

The next course of action is putting him in the spare bedroom, which is kind of a pain since this is where we keep both litter boxes and end up having to take one out into the hallway for the girl one cat. (We can't lock her in there with him because he will relentlessly chase her until she loses her cool). Now in this room, he's doing the same things, but also knocking things off our desks (which are in this room) and basically wrecking everything we own.

We have read the advice pages that say to just tough it out and ignore it but the kicker of it all -- we live in an upper apartment. I can only imagine how annoying we must be as neighbors, between Murray's bad behavior and our stomping around/rearranging the house at 3:30am. I feel terrible.

So we have done the worst, and given in probably too many times where we will feed him his breakfast just to get him to shut up. Sometimes it works, other times he will just eat it up then start right back up with the behavior.

My boyfriend and I take turns going and sleeping out in the living room with him, which kind of helps, but basically just turns into that unlucky person becoming defense for the door and allowing whoever got to stay in the bed to sleep. This is getting old. We both work, I go to school still and we need sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've tried the spray bottles, toys that are special just for morning time, feedings right before bed, playtime before bed to tire him out, and we even bought a nerf gun to shoot bullets for him to chase after.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we're looking at options. CBD? Cat crate that will take up the size of our dining space? Ssscat? Anything?

We need something that will help everyone, including the other people who live in our apartment building. We love our little buddy, but I'd love to get a full night's sleep. I can't help but give him the stink eye as I leave for work or school and he's getting comfy for his daytime naps.

I was promised that ""she is spayed"" and her initial moving in items were to be paid(they weren't) for if I agreed to keep her.

However, ""she"" turned out to be a non-neutered male cat instead once he got to me and I worried about how my other cat(a very timid adopted rescue) would react.

Fast forward, Pat gets neutered next week. Nothing has been paid for aside from me and his extensive vet visits as he has no common sense and retains absolutely no information when it comes to training. He has severe dental issues and a chewing problem where he chews on plastic until his face is bloodied. He had no vaccinations and was covered in fleas that took 2 weeks to clear.
Why does all this matter? Its important for cats to have background info, too. Hes not inherently a bad guy- just spent his whole life spoiled and slightly neglected by a teenager.

The real point. Think of all the annoying things cats do.. Pat does that. He jumps on my counters, he runs and jumps behind my TV, he has killed two of my Gerbils. He claws and meows at my bedroom door at night and all morning so I bought a $50 4ft gate for my doorway. He now can jump it and sits at the top of it screaming at me. There has never been a morning where he didnt started screaming and howling until his voice breaks and turns into that ugly howling noise like he is dying. Sometimes hes started as early as 5am.
He runs into my fridge/freezer every time it opens and latches onto whatever packaging he can. If anything with food is left out(even a touched napkin), he will absolutely demolish and chew the whole thing. I have to separate and feed the cats in different rooms or he will fight my other cat and eat her food. He eats my plants and knocks them out of the windows and breaks the pots. Ive had to horde most of them in my room. He digs into and rips up my trash so I keep it in a cabinet now. Ive tried placing him where hes allowed to sit instead of my counter and gave him a treat. But then he gets goblin-style and starts going haywire for food so I can't do that anymore. I can not eat anything unless I put him in a different room or he will eat it and fight me for it so I just dont eat much these days.

Like, at this point. I dont know what to do. The deal and info i initially agreed on did not happen nor was it true. Ive spent hundreds on vet visits due to his hygiene and stupidity. Ive bought millions of toys to make outside my room as fun as possible. Cat trees, tunnels, automatic lazers, mice toys, etc. Ive used a spray bottle sometimes until finally he chewed it up. Ive used foil, cat ""keep off""(I've even used straight up essential oils where I dont want him), etc. I'm looking into those bottles that just spurt air if they come nearby it but if he can jump my gate and sit on top- whats the point. I live in a small apartment and have 3 neighbors who I KNOW can hear him and I'm so afraid theyre going to start making complaints and i cant have that. I already have to replace 2 doors that he has clawed to sawdust.

But i fear giving him back to my sibling who lives with our mom because she will NOT keep him and will 100% dump him outside somewhere. He is a very sweet and affectionate boy with separation anxiety. I'm reaching a low point mentally where small things are making it worse so these things like 5am howling so I cannot sleep are affecting me.

I just need any idea on what to do. I live alone and cannot live in fear that I'm going to come in and find another one of my gerbils and pry it from his mouth again. That shit was traumatizing.

I'll literally try anything.",CatTraining,I'm just desperate by this point. [Untrained cat advice pls]
wootiown,1611377817,l35kqd,3,False,1,"I love my kitty, but for lack of a better word, he's an asshole. Not like a mean cat. He's very weird. For lack of a better word he seems extremely bipolar. 

He's about 4, lives in a 1200sqft apartment with everything he could ever want. No big changes, a giant cat tree and tons of stuff to scratch, places to hide and places to cuddle, a windowsill bed he loves to sit on and watch outside, tons of toys and the best food money can buy, and a perfectly clean litter box. He's our only cat, but me and my roommate both work from home so we keep him company all the time. I've been trying to get him used to a harness to walk him, but he just kinda deactivates whenever I try. I have no idea what his life was before we adopted him last year, but he was a stray. 

He's anxious as hell and literally anything will send him running and hiding. Knock on the door, starting the dryer, grabbing a pan. Often just something as simple as standing up near him or attempting to pet him at the wrong time. He almost never comes out from under my bed when anyone else is over, and is extremely territorial at all other times. Often just touching him while hes sitting or lying results in him hissing, swatting, or biting. If he actually IS affectionate, he might be happy for 45 seconds before flipping like a switch and scratching and hissing again. 

I've tried to train him in every way I've seen online, and nothing works. He doesn't really even like treats, any of them. I finally found freeze dried tuna is the only way treat he likes, yet still whether he touches it is a coin flip. I've tried all sorts of other tuna or other flavored treats and he won't even touch them, which makes training him even more difficult. There doesn't seem to be anything he truly loves, no toy or treat or anything. 

Today I went to hand him a treat, placed it on the floor and he ate it. I attempted to have him eat one out of my hand and he promptly clawed my hand so much that it drew dripping free flowing blood, jumped back, hissed, and sprinted away and hid. Because I fed him a treat. That doesn't seem normal at all.

He also seems to like my roommate better than myself. While he stays in my room all day because that's ""his room,"" he often ignores me for my roommate. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. Hes rarely affectionate towards me at all- he'll occasionally rub against my roommates legs and whatnot but never much more than that, and he usually merely brushes up against me before jumping on the bed or hiding somewhere.

I have a vet checkup scheduled for next week to make sure he's not in pain (though he doesn't seem to be) and to discuss potential medication.

What can I do to chill my cat out and make him more happy and relaxed? Any recommendations for rewards, or ways to just make him more comfortable with me? Is medication my best option, or what else can I try to actually make him, well, like me?

We've had him for 3 months and it's only become a recent problem, I am guessing because we had a guest over using the bathroom and they left the (enticing!) end of the toilet paper hanging...and since then it's all play for the kitten.

Things we've tried: double sided tape on the cover part to discourage his approach; unfortunately this cat loves playing with tape and might have had an adverse effect; spraying the area with various ""negative"" smells like citrus, lemongrass, etc (we do not have access to Bitter Apple in our country); other toys to tempt him away, which only has limited success; loud noises when he gets on the toilet seat cover, which we only just started doing a couple of times but he keeps trying again

We had 2 cats (Sol - approx 1 year old Male and Ludo - approx 3 years old Male, both are neutered)  and a dog (Mina - Yorkie, 3 years old female, spayed) who all get along fine, and are very affectionate. In November we got a 3rd cat (Misty, approx 1 year old Female apparently spayed according to vet we took her to.) from my wife's mum and brought her back to our place. Her mother found Misty as a stray under a house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since she's been living here she has not really gotten along with any of the other animals, seemingly tolerating Sol and Mina, but showing hostility towards Ludo. Ludo responds in kind and will chase/hunt her when hissed at or if she runs from him. 

&amp;#x200B;

She also does not seem to want to be petted. If we approach with a hand out, she'll rub her head against our hand and allow pets for a few seconds before hissing/growling and swatting/biting at the hand. This is apparently how she was at my wife's mums house as well.

&amp;#x200B;

She has recently started peeing in the bathroom sinks, despite knowing where the litter trays are, and having used them just fine before. It seems she would rather pee in the sink than go past the other animals.

queenofthera,1611010008,l05vah,6,False,1,"Hey,


Hope you can help because we are at our wit's end. Our cat is 12, and we have had her for four years. For most of this time, she has gone to the toilet in our garden.

She is prone to urinary infections and got one in around October. (She is fed a specialist food to try and combat this and she has easy access access to running water on demand). At this point she started peeing on the carpet. We took her to the vets and she was treated with anti inflammatories. The infection was sorted, yet she had got used to peeing on the carpet and only went outside to poo. 


To try and save our carpet, we got a litterbox. All was fine, but she stopped going outside to poo and did it in the box instead (probably because she's too lazy to go out). That was fine until we bought a different type of litter. 

At this point, she continues to pee in the litterbox but will only shit on the floor next to it. 

Things we tried to do to combat this:

1) went back to the original type of litter

2) Got a bigger litterbox 

3) thoroughly clean the areas she shits on

4) Move the litterbox so that it's over where she shits

5) ensure she has privacy when using the litterbox

6) putting the poo in the litterbox briefly to try and 'trick' her into thinking that she's been there previously. 


...yet she still will only shit beside the litterbox


There is no discernible source of stress; no changes to her environment, and we even have a pheromone plug-in to try and promote feelings of wellbeing.

SnooGoats5892,1610927860,kziapc,25,False,1,"Hey!

I apologize that this will be long, I hope there aren't too many typos but I am emotional. So I apologize for that too. I'll try and give as much info as I can. I'm looking for any advice, but please be aware that I cannot afford anything overly expensive as I've already spent several thousand dollars to try and fix this, but I'll get into that in a bit. I also cannot continue taking this cat to new vets, so any recommendations to ""Oh, just take him in for a second opinion"" will, unfortunately, go ignored. I've taken this cat for 20+ opinions over the two years that this has been an issue, and every time his tests and evaluations have come back perfectly healthy. 

I got Mowgli and his brother Louie from a local rescue a little over two years ago when both cats were about 6 months old. At the time, Mowgli was an extremely shy cat. He hated people looking at him let alone touch him. His brother, Louie, was a social butterfly. Louie is also a polydactyl, so naturally, everyone wanted the ""cat with extra toes"". They were listed as a Bonded pair (meaning they had to be adopted together). This was done in hopes that Mowgli would get adopted. They were hoping that Louie's charm would entice people to look past Mowgli's shy nature and adopt the two cats. They spent three months in the shelter. I adopted the two for the opposite reason. I felt horrible the first time I saw Mowgli, scarred, and underweight. I absolutely had to take him home. 

The moment I brought the two home, it was obvious that this would be a long process. Mowgli hid in a small space between my shower and sink for WEEKS! He would only come out if I wasn't in the house. If he could hear any noise, he'd hide. I spent hours in that room just sitting, hanging out, and sometimes playing. It took several weeks before he was comfortable enough to even be out around me. Then several more for him to allow me to pet him. Fast forward to today and he is almost as social as his brother, even with strangers (though he is still wary). Anyways, I need you to understand that this cat was never forced to interact with me, my boyfriend, or the dogs we had. He was allowed to take as much time as he needed which ended up being around 6 months. 

The issues started a few weeks after I brought them home. I noticed a strong smell around the area he liked to hide and soon discovered that he had been peeing in that same corner. Obviously I immediately purchase heavy-duty cat urine cleaners, a blacklight, and a shop-vac. I cleaned the area until nothing registered on my blacklight, bought an extra litter box (making the total 3), and sectioned off that area that he liked to hide in for 24hrs so that the cleaner could dry. Once I cut off that hiding spot, he began to pee everywhere else. By the bed, in the other corners of the room, next to the litterbox. Even in the sink and bathtub sometimes. Now, keep in mind, we had cameras all over the room. His brother, Louie, NEVER had a single accident outside the box. Even to this day, Louie has never peed or sprayed. And Mowgli has never pooped outside the box. It is only ever pee. On top of that, he doesn't always pee outside the box. I will watch him go in and use the box ALL THE TIME. I haven't been able to determine a pattern for when he does pee outside the box, it seems random to me. 

At the time, I figured it was just him acclimating to a new house. He and his brother had been stray's before they were found, so I thought it would just take a while before he picked up on the litter box. I also called the rescue to see if he had ever peed outside the box there, and they said no. After a few weeks, I took him to the vet, thinking he might have a UTI or something. He didn't, they said he was perfectly healthy and to just wait it out, that he'd grow out of it. So I did. It never stopped. It started to get worse after 8 or 9 months when he started peeing on my bed and pillow. I took him back to the vet at that point but they said the same thing, this time telling me to contact a behaviorist. I got in contact with the behavior team at the shelter that I got them from. They had me change the litter I was using to the same one that the shelter used, and that actually seemed to work for a while. I didn't find any new accidents for several weeks. But it did start up again. 

The litter change did seem to help a little. Where I had been cleaning multiple accidents a day, I was now only cleaning an accident every-other-day. I considered this a win and hoped it would continue going down from there. When it didn't, the behaviorist told me to take him to a new vet, which I did, but they told me the same thing; that he was in perfect health. The behaviorist had me try the SCATT motion sensor spray, which was a little contraption that would spray a blast of air whenever the cat would walk by it. This did keep him out of his most common areas, but he would just find new areas to pee in. I tried several special diets, calming sprays, and candles as well as an anti-anxiety medication for several months (prescribed by my vet) but nothing actually stopped the problem. Some would stop it for a day or two, but never permanently. I got another behaviorist after the problem persisted, who was unable to fix the problem though she had me take him to a new vet as well, who told me he was healthy. I repeated that lengthy process two more times, totaling 4 behaviorists and 5 vets before the cat was 2. 

Eventually, I had to move. The new house was MUCH bigger, which seemed to make the situation SO MUCH WORSE! He started peeing several times a day again. I would clean up an accident before work, after work, and right before bed. Since moving to the new town, he's seen three more vets and two private behaviorists, all of which weren't able to help. At this point, the only thing I have not tried is allowing him to be an outdoor cat, which I don't feel comfortable doing given that I live right next to a busy highway and my neighborhood is filled with stray dogs and cats (I don't live in the best area thanks to how f\*cking expensive Cali is). I am now desperate, as the last inspection my landlord made ended with her telling me that the issue needed to be fixed, or the cats needed to go. I don't really blame her for doing that, I have had to replace two carpets and several sections of hardwood flooring. He has ruined couches, chairs, and too many shoes to count. I've spent most of my life savings trying to repair this house that I don't own. If I didn't have dogs I would just take my cats and move somewhere with a better neighborhood for them, and try and introduce them to the outdoors. The problem is, the house that I am in now was the FIRST house that I found after months of searching that would rent to me despite the fact I have a dog that looks like a Pitbull. He's not, he's a Staffy mix, but it's enough that nobody wants to rent to me. Even now, with all this looming over my head, I've been sending out applications and making phone calls left and right. Nobody cares about the number of animals I have, but the moment they ask to meet my dogs or see a picture they instantly turn me away. I have to think about my other animals, so if I can't fix this issue I'll have to take them back to the shelter in order to keep where I currently am. 

Also, I want to make it clear that the dogs aren't the problem. I've never met a cat that loves dogs as much as Mowgli does. They are all adult dogs, two are seniors, and the amount that these animals snuggle and love on each other is insane. To this day, Mowgli would rather spend time with the dogs than with me. He absolutely prefers their company to that of any people that enter my house. He and his brother also get along amazingly, they have never gotten into a fight and are also constantly loving on each other. 

As of right now, he was last seen by a vet at the beginning of December 2020, where he got a clean bill of health. He is currently having anywhere between 5 and 6 accidents a week, and we have four litterboxes with a pine litter (this is the only brand I have found that he likes, I recently did a litter experiment in which I put several litter boxes next to each other, each with a different litter, and allowed him to pick his favorite). 

I am open to any suggestions. I just need help. I want to fix things, I want to keep my cats. They are truly good cats. They are kind, loving, affectionate, and adorable. They always brighten my day. And the way they get along with the dogs warms my heart! Please, if you have any ideas, I'm open to anything.",CatTraining,My cat won't stop peeing and spraying in my house

Inuzuka_pound,1610906196,kzb736,2,False,1,"Hello everyone! My wife and I are planning on getting a mini-doodle mix in a few months, but I‚Äôm a bit worried about introducing our cat to the puppy and helping them to co-exist. Our cat is a 5yo female who is VERY human loving (loves our reptiles and bird too), but doesn‚Äôt so much like other mammals. Since we adopted her at 4-5months old we have introduced her to other animals and people, but I‚Äôm looking for more advise on introducing them to each other and coexisting without loosing the cat to a life of hiding under the bed.
She is cautiously avoidant/curious of small mammals (gerbals/rabbits),but straight out of the gate she despised other cats and avoided dogs. We introduced her to an older cat-friendly cat (she kept her distance but would stare intently, follow the other cat, and hiss at him, but never attacked him), a litter of 3month old kittens (the kittens were kept in their carrier/crate and we let out cat come up to them, our cat immediately started hissing and raised her hackles but did not try to attack them through the carrier), and she has seen neighborhood cats through the windows (most of the time she would just stare at them and hiss, but there was one cat that would actively come up to our porch door and they fought through the glass).

Her experience with dogs is better, though, which is why my wife and I are bringing a puppy into the mix. When our cat was still young we introduced her to a very calm corgi (this dog literally did not care about the cat and just smelled around the house) and our cat sat there and stared intently until she hissed and ran off to hide. At this same time frame our cat had access to a ground level window where people would come and go from our building. Eventually, after weeks of hissing and running) she made friends with a small Scottie type dog to the point where they would smell each other through the window/mesh and then be on their own ways w/o any aggression or fear response. At the same time frame as the kittens she was also introduced to a puppy that she stared at and then hissed/ranaway from, but she did take a warning swat at the puppy when it got into her face (we kept the puppy from chasing her, but she was also following the puppy around to watch from a distance). Her latest interaction with dogs has been mostly watching them from a second story window and being introduced to an adult dog. This time the dog was interested in her, just like the puppy was, but we kept the dog on a leash and calm and let her decide the distance. Again, she would watch from a distance and hiss/runaway to hide, but she never tried to attack him and when we interacted with her with the dog in sight she would rub us, flop on her side, and even return slow blinks. This same dog even spent a night/day over and while she chose to hide for most of this time, she never hissed at him or tried to seek him out to stare intently at him.
All of these interactions have been on her own territory. Our current plans are to move her food and litter box into a quiet back room that the puppy will not have access to and to put up a gate so she may choose when to interact and how close she wants to get to the puppy; we‚Äôre already starting to move her stuff so she has time to adjust to the new layout before the puppy arrives. Her cat tree will stay where it‚Äôs currently at in the hallway/living room and she has access to several counters, tables, and shelves to be high up in the living room.",CatTraining,Help introducing cat to new puppy
CallMeMrsSlender,1610836695,kyt4xg,4,False,1,"Hello,

I'm curious to know if any of you have resources on cat specific cooperative care similar to Deb Jones's Cooperative Care with dogs. My cat's been diagnosed idiopathic hypoparathryiodism;  meaning once he is stable he will require daily dosages of calcium/vitamin D solution and semi-regular blood draws for blood calcium checks for the rest of his life- he's 3 years and 2 months old if that puts that into some perspective for you. 

I'm a dog trainer/dog sports hobbyist so clicker training and conditioning is second nature to me; my dogs both participate in cooperative care techniques and when my cat was a kitten I ensured he only had the best experiences with vet care, body handling, and general cat care. He's been amazing through this rough ordeal but it's hard for me to fathom the distress it's put him through and any back slides on handling its caused. He does allow me to pill him as well as  nicely opening his mouth when it's time for me to give his oral meds (now 2x a day, but once well will be 1x a day forever) ; but of course it tastes horrendous and is undoubtly stressful. 

If all else fails and there's not any cat specific literature on cooperative care, I'm sure I can adapt the dog book to suit my needs. Thanks",CatTraining,Cooperative Care w/Cats?

We started them with the food they were eating at the shelter, as we wanted things to be as familiar as possible. We also started putting out wet food since we know that is much healthier for them. We get different flavors and rotate between about 10 of them. The 5F loves the wet food and has adjusted easily to that. 

The 2F doesn't seem to eat any of the wet food, only the dry food. We put out 1/4 cup twice a day.  We tried switching her to a healthier brand, and at first it seemed perfectly fine. She was eating the same amount and didn't seem to notice that we were slowly working in a different dry food. 

But lately, I've noticed that the 2F is eating less and less.  She's eating, but not nearly enough. She seems fine with treats and will eat them when offered. She doesn't seem to like any of the wet foods, no matter the flavor. I see her eating the dry food, but only a few bites each day.

PM_ME_HOLE_PICS,1610769197,kybd3u,26,False,1,"In June of this year I adopted a pair of kittens from a rural farm that had a litter. They're sisters, raised from birth together, and then I adopted them together. Completely identical lives up until this point. Both have a clean bill of health from the vet, and all of their vaccinations.

For the ease of discussion, we'll call them Abby (Cat A) and Bruce (Cat B).

Abby has been an amazing companion. She very rarely meows, she sits in my lap and just lets me pet her, she has never clawed at me or caused any problems. If I am sleeping, she lays next to me and naps. If I'm busy with something, I'll give her a scritch on the head and she walks off to play in her tree and leave me alone. Just an absolutely perfect cat.

Bruce, on the other hand, has turned into an absolute fucking nightmare over the past three months.

* Bruce meows *constantly.* Like 16 hours a day, she just meows, grumbles, howls. It is to the point I am worried there will be a noise complaint from neighbors soon. I can hear it distinctly through doors and I fear it can be heard through walls, too.

* Bruce rubs against my feet all the time with her nose/face, and has a couple of times clawed at me and drawn blood.

* Bruce *constantly* knocks over her water bowl. Intentionally. It is to the point I have to mop it up and refill it 8-9 times a day or they'll go without water. I even purchased a huge gravity-fed bottle that weighs twice her and she *still* found out how to knock it over and untwist it.

* Bruce even harasses her sister. I've seen several times where she has cornered Abby to the point she hisses in fear/anger, and she will intentionally run over and swat at Abby when they are both given treats so she can have both of them.

* Bruce never lets me sleep. She claws at my eyelids if I fall asleep. I have to lock them out of my bedroom, which causes her to howl all night. I'm currently only able to sleep by using both earplugs and a white noise app on my phone. She literally sits outside my door for eight hours a night, howling.

So far, in order to rectify these things, I have tried:

* Giving Bruce so much more attention. If I pick her up and place her in my lap, she sits still for about 2-3 minutes before she hops off and starts meowing at me again. If I stand up and try to pet her on the ground, she will run away, meow at me from a distance, and claw at something.

* On the flip side, ignoring her when she is misbehaving. Doesn't change anything, because *giving* her attention is (apparently) not what she wants.

* Cleaning litter box daily, sometimes even twice a day. No change.

* Giving Bruce treats. She'll eat them (all of them, including to the point of hurting her sister to get more), then go right back to meowing and rubbing at me.

* Spraying Bruce with water. It works for a minute or two -- she runs off when sprayed, and then 1-2 minutes later goes right back to what she was doing. She's getting so used to it that she has learned how to dodge the stream and knows which bottle is the one she gets sprayed with, so she can go right back to hassling me even faster.

* Playing with them. I have a cat ""fishing pole"" and a laser pointer. Bruce goes absolutely *insane* for the laser pointer to the point she is panting and lying on the floor to cool off after 25-30 minutes. ~5 minutes later, she's back up howling.

I'm just absolutely baffled. I've read tons and tons of threads on this sub, and all of them mention things like an anxiety trigger, or being solitary, or being bored... but none of these are the case for her, because Abby is a *perfect* little cat. Bruce lives in the *exact* same circumstances and living space, had the *exact* same experiences as a baby, but misbehaves so much that earlier today I actually had an anxiety attack and broke down a bit. It's getting to the point I don't even want to be at home because I'll have to deal with her and I have *no* idea what to do. I'm reaching my limit, and I'll have to drop her off at the shelter if I don't find some way to relieve her issues.

I‚Äôve had one of my cats, Ariel, for 4 years. She‚Äôs 8 years old, female, spayed, and has been the only cat for this time.

I recently adopted a pair of cats after their owner died - Rusty (10 year old neutered male) and Phoebe (5 year old spayed female). 

To begin with, I placed Rusty and Phoebe in a separate room and let them settle in there. They got used to me and comfortable in their own surroundings. 

I then started to swap litter trays over, scratch pads and blankets to get everyone comfortable with each others‚Äô scents.

Ariel reacted very badly to the other cats‚Äô scents at first, and would hiss at my hand after I‚Äôd stroked the other two. But over time, she became unbothered. 

I started feeding Ariel on one side of the door, and Rusty and Phoebe on the other. Ariel was hesitant at first, but eventually became fine with that too. 

Then came swapping them over. I would put Ariel in Rusty and Phoebe‚Äôs room, and let R&amp;P explore the rest of the house (without Ariel meeting/seeing them). Ariel again was very uncomfortable with their smell but eventually stopped reacting to it. 

Then, I opened the door a crack and let Ariel see the other two. She made a sort of low nervous noise, but didn‚Äôt go towards them, or more away.  I let her see them for a couple minutes a few times a day, eventually having the door open completely so they could interact. It seemed like all the cats were learning each other‚Äôs boundaries - when Ariel would get too close to the new cats or vice versa, one or both would back away, and so I thought all was going well. 

Rusty and Phoebe previously lived with other animals and cats and haven‚Äôt been bothered by Ariel at all during the entire process. 

For about two weeks now, the cats have all had the entire house to roam, and everyone was getting on fine. Ariel and Phoebe would eat right next to each other. All 3 cats would lay in bed with me, no problem. 

However, recently I noticed when Phoebe comes into the room, Ariel will stalk her like prey, until she gets close enough to jump and attack her (claws, no biting). She will sometimes corner Phoebe too, and Phoebe freezes and tries to be submissive, but Ariel doesn‚Äôt relent, and when Phoebe slowly tries to escape Ariel attacks and chases her through the house.

All growing up my parents had cats, and they LOVED my mom, were always happy to see me, and tolerated/avoided my dad.

My dad has been semi-frequently living with me this year (covid) and i have a young cat who is friendly to a fault.  He's always keeping tabs on what i'm doing, runs to meet/greet strangers, and even sidles up to strange dogs if they don't act aggressively.  Anyone can pick him up, hold him, and play with his feets.  He's crazy about me now, but even when we were getting to know each other he always wanted to be nearby. 

It was a surprise that over time he doesn't like my dad much.  It's been a great opportunity to see why Dad never had much luck with cats.  Dad ignores my boy most of the time unless he's interested in interacting with the cat, where he totally overwhelms the kitty.  He skipped the 'dating' part of the relationship.  The part where you make eye contact and look away, you say hello and ignore, you sit together and do your thing, you play together using a toy as an intermediary... all the little subtle communication things you do that say 'i'm aware we're sharing space, and i like it.'  

When he wants to hold the cat the cat is apprehensive and inclined to jump away, and my dad just holds him tighter.  Kitty relents cuz he's not scared, but he never sticks around for long.  ...Let the cat leave, dad!  Pick him up again in a few minutes, and let him leave again.

He's a friendly kitty; my neighbor (who previously thought cats were shitty pets) can scoop him up and he's thrilled she's holding him.

Our older male, Waffles, is very much the alpha and is very territorial over our bedroom.

ShadyAdel,1610285573,kueism,15,False,1,"**TL;DR** Cat prefers to go on the floor over using The Last Litter when it's on the toilet seat but when it's on the floor the cat uses it.

*The Last Litter is a product the gradually trains cats to go in the toilet.*

Towards the end of last year I found a lost kitten that is believed to be 1 y/o, by the beginning of December I started training her to go potty in the toilet using The Last Litter product, the product sits on your toilet seat and is made up of a base and inside it are multiple ring levels, you start by removing the smallest one in the middle and work your way out till you don't need the product anymore and all you have to do is leave the toilet seat down. The process started out well where I made sure the cat knew where it was and she actually did use it just fine, that is until I removed the smallest ring and she used it once , after that she just stopped using it whenever it was on the toilet seat! She prefers to poop on hard floor over using it while it is on the toilet seat. So I thought maybe I'll restart training from an even easier level by using the backup ring panel which I hadn't cut through yet and leaving it on the floor for a couple of days and she was using it just fine with zero issues, as soon as I placed it on the toilet seat she started going on the floor again!

Yesterday, I waited with her in the toilet until she started digging at the floor so I did a ts ts sound with my tongue which she generally understands to mean no and lured her to it without any physical contact as I wanted her to feel like it was her choice to use it, she did use it while I was there, I praised her and pet her then cleaned the product and placed it on the toilet seat only to come back today to find her poop on the floor again! Cleaned it up and removed the product (placed it on the floor) to use the toilet and she immediately jumped down to pee in it, so I carried it with her in it and placed it on the seat until she was done but from the recent pattern I know that if I leave it there she will not use it and will go on the floor. I'm not sure as to what to do now but I would really like to get her trained to the toilet on the long run and not have to use a litter box at all.

Side info:

\- I have a 9 m/o Rottweiler puppy who is a gentle giant that wants to play with any animal in sight, he always jumps in excitement and runs towards her whenever he sees her but this is not a new thing as this was always there since before we even started using the product. She hasn't really gotten used to him yet so her refuge while he is out of his room is the toilet tank or to stay on the product if it is clean (I clean it after every use) as he is not allowed to go in the bathroom

\- We have had multiple vet visits since starting the training with the most recent one being 4 days ago, so any health issues are ruled out as she has already had all her shots and the vet deemed her to be healthy

\- We haven't changed ANY habits or places since starting with this training, the only thing that changed was removing the smallest ring and when she didn't use it I want back to the backup panel with all the rings but what stuck is her not using it on the toilet seat.",CatTraining,"Cat stopped using ""The Last Litter"" on the seat and only uses it on the floor"

Oliver: 9 years old and uses his paws to do a lot
Carlos: 4 years old and meows constantly 

Now, the point initially was to give me a better idea of why Carlos was whining at me all the time but the buttons came and because Oliver naturally uses his paws, he was much quicker at figuring out what I wanted him to do while Carlos just stared at me.

I started with touching a treat to their paw, pressed the button, and then gave it to them.
Then I put my hand over a treat and when they touched my hand, I‚Äôd press the button and they‚Äôd get the treat. Carlos didn‚Äôt get this so my question here is, how do I get him to understand what I‚Äôm asking? I thought of using Catnip instead? But I‚Äôm not sure if that will work since once they have catnip they go a little loopy.
And my second question is, once I moved on with Oliver to touching the button for a treat, he‚Äôd go for the sides. At first I still gave it to him for that. But after a bit I would put the treat on top and he would touch it with his paw but not hard enough to actually press the button himself. So my question is, is that ok and should I assume that with enough training he‚Äôll eventually do it or is there a way I can make the buttons easier to press for him? 
I just don‚Äôt want to have the buttons out and have him touch it and me not give him the treat because I feel like that would be confusing.

We bought him a couple of months ago after our old boy passed away earlier this year, and he was 8 weeks old when we got him. He is about four and a half months old now and has not yet been snipped. For the most part he has been fairly well behaved - doesn't scratch the carpet or miss his litter - however he has always been very talkative and cries a lot for food and attention.

I was in the middle of exams when we got him so was at home a lot and spent a lot of time with him early on, but whenever my partner was at home she would give him a lot of attention and love. For whatever reason, he is absolutely in love with me and always shows it - wakes me up with kisses in the morning and sleeps beside me, always looks at me with big loving eyes. This saddens my partner a little as she is a big cat lover and gives him all the love and attention in the world. 

Over the last month he has become a little aggressive with her and we cannot understand why or curb his behaviour. If she is walking around he will run and jump for her feet and bite them. If she is playing with him he will suddenly latch onto her arms and bite them. Sometimes if she picks him up for a hug he will do the same - latch on and bite. He does the same to me occasionally but not as frequently.

So my one cat, Ivy (bengal, 5) has been now going to a few vet visits as she was having seizures. She has had to be sedated when going as she had a bad experience as a kitten and she is horrible at the vet. After a vet visit our girls (other cat Mary is her sister from same litter) always sort it out after about 3 days. We usually bathe her to help reset the scent. The issue is now after starting phenobarbital for her seizures, Ivy had to go back to get bloodwork for check her levels. Well unfortunately this specialist muzzled her at her visit because she is definitely all talk and she wanted to take a precaution. As it‚Äôs covid I wasn‚Äôt allowed in the appointment with her so I honestly have no idea how bad it went for her but since this visit where she was muzzled she has no recovered from it. I was assured being lowered in phenobarbital would not cause any behavioral changes aggressively. I have tried asking the specialist for her opinion on how to handle the girls and she said she is not a behavior specialist and can‚Äôt help us. 
It has now been a month and Ivy growls any time my cat walks by her or even looks at her. After a long period of growling Mary will start to eventually cry back and get frustrated. Extended she will start to lunge and I will separate whoever is initiating into a time out. I have asked my local vet for help and we‚Äôve been trying feliaway wall scent and it‚Äôs not helping. I try to get them to play together and they will be close by but eventually it ends in aggression as well. I asked my vet if this will be permanent and she wouldn‚Äôt give me an answer. They‚Äôve always cuddled, and done everything together and now after a month of daily growling and fighting I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Just starting to feel like this is our life now. It doesn‚Äôt help she has more blood work coming up so I know that will just end any slight progression we‚Äôve made. 
At this point I‚Äôm just feeling like I don‚Äôt know what direction to take. Is me not taking any action going to cause permanent issues? Is she going to be permanently scarred from being muzzled? I am just horrified how she even felt being alone at her appointment, pinned and blinded.

At first it wasn't bad, but about two years ago Tabitha's previous favorite person moved out of the house, after this both Charlotte and Tabitha got a lot worse. Charlotte wouldn't let Tabitha near either of the food bowls, water, or any of the litter boxes- because of this we had to feed Tabitha in a separate room and Tabitha began to pee EVERYWHERE, it got to the point where my mom banished Tabitha to the back porch. I moved her into my room within a day of her being put on the back porch, with her own litter box, cat tree, food and water. This helped immensely, and there are less altercations between her and Charlotte now... she has free roam of the house as my door is always open to her, but she chooses to stay in my room and only leaves when I'm not in there. When she does leave (to follow me) Charlotte is never far away, I try to shoo her off but unlike Tabitha, Charlotte is incredibly brave and short of picking her up and moving her away she won't leave Tabitha alone. 

Problems:
Tabitha is never comfortable unless I'm nearby and is incredibly clingy, if I leave the room she'll either cry for me to come back or will follow and try to ""herd"" me back to the room- and when I'm in the room she has to be directly on top of me or right next to me. It really makes me happy that after so long of having her she loves me so much (she only started letting me pet her when she was about 5 years old and wouldn't let me do that for long, so being at this point is amazing), but I know this isn't healthy for her. I want her to be more brave, to be able to venture into the house without me needing to be right next to her, and I don't want her to stress out when I'm not home (whenever I'm not home for an extended period of time my mom tells me Tabitha constantly cries for me, my mom tries to pet her but Tabitha doesn't really let anyone but me touch her now). Does anyone know what I can do to make her more brave? Any ideas on how to make her less dependent on me? I love her a lot, and I want her to have the best life possible and I know she can't have that being stuck in my room (albeit she is choosing to do that).

Charlotte also has problems (obviously), while she's very brave, friendly with everyone, and has never had any peeing issues- she's very mean to Tabitha. When Fiona was still alive this was never an issue, but it's just gotten so bad. I've really begun to resent Charlotte for the way she treats Tabitha now (though that resentment is probably also because she was part of the reason my last cat passed, while they were playing Fiona had a stroke), which I know is wrong but I can't help it...I know some cats are just like this, but does anyone know what I can do to calm Charlotte down? Any ideas on how to improve her relationship with Tabitha? I don't want to have to constantly worry about Charlotte hurting Tabitha, especially considering she's so much bigger than her.",CatTraining,"Nervous, Overly Dependent Cat &amp; Bully Cat"

The 5 year adjusted quickly, and now loves to play with us and will cuddle with us when she wants attention while the feral cat is getting more comfortable with us but slowly. Very slowly. 

The problem is that the younger cat loves to chase the older cat. Sometimes it seems reciprocal, and like they are having fun. But lately it has escalated to the younger cat cornering, chasing, batting and in general harassing the older cat. The older cat hisses at her, and while she used to back off, she is pushing her boundaries now. No growling, no injuries or anything. But I do think it stresses out the older cat. 

I think there are a few things going on here. 

1. I think she's jealous that of the attention the older one receives. (We'd love to give 2 year old more attention and play time, but she is mostly too scared to receive it.)

2. She's bored and under-stimulated. We are struggling to keep her occupied and 'played out'. She won't really play with us, but LOVES to play with her sister and gets a little too aggressive with it.

Bad move.

Of course our female went absolutely bonkers apeshit like I've never seen. Actively aggressive chasing people around that got near her, and my feet are so scratched up from her attacking me they were a bloody mess. She even peed a little in her rage.

My cat has recently had a vomiting episode on boxing day (12.26)  and has been off of their food since. So far their vet has ruled out dental problems and obstructions, given a long acting antibiotic and steroids to ward off any infections or swelling and an appetite stimulant. 

The vet will be doing blood work on him when we next go in, in a few days. At worst case I can syringe feed him churu or blended chicken but I don't really want to. He's had a single dose of the appetite meds and it makes him almost himself again, but as soon as it wears off he's disinterested and mopey, when he used to be very food motivated

The cat will drink but won't eat of his own accord. He will tolerate a small ( less than 5g) amount of shredded chicken once a day if its hand fed over the course of a few hours. He's not vomiting it up or showing obvious signs of nausea. Behaviourally he's lethargic and generally off. 

The appetite stimulant his vet gave him makes him want and eat about 50% of his normal diet, but we don't have that long term yet, and need to discuss it when we take him in again.

So far we have tried offering him turkey, chicken, tuna, churu tubes, pate wet food, his usual wet and dry food and temptations treats. We have tied most things either blended, room temp, warmed or cold and in different parts of the house on different times. We aren't forcing him, just offering it and giving him the choice.

Mammoth-Armadillo450,1609292550,kms642,20,False,1,"Hi there. Brand new to the forum. Desperate for help. 

We have 2 cats, 7 yr old male &amp; female siblings. We have had them since 6 months old. They have always gotten along wonderfully. 

I took the female to the vet yesterday (after she had some vomiting for a couple days). Cats were acting totally fine with one another during her sick time, and the vomiting had actually ended before the vet visit. 

After the vet visit, her brother smelled her, hissed &amp; snarled. I had forgotten they had done that years ago (but that time it was the male at the vet...it took a couple days for them to get over it). Even I could smell rubbing alcohol on her, so I‚Äôm not surprised he didn‚Äôt like her smell. 

She seems to have been very frightened &amp; disturbed by his initial hiss &amp; snarl and has spent the day hissing and growling if he gets anywhere near her. He seems to just want to smell her, and be near her - he hasn‚Äôt been aggressive towards her today, just curious. 

But now SHE is the aggressor. I had them sleep in separate rooms last night. After 24 hrs, they were getting a little closer to one another, still keeping distance and she was still instigating hissing and growling but it had been getting better throughout the day today. They could tolerate being in the same room.  

Well...about an hour ago, he got too close. Right by her neck. They smelled each other, no hissing.I thought we had turned a corner. Then he tried to smell her rear end and she LOST it. It turned into a literal tumbling, chasing cat fight that was terrifying to see and watch. I was able to get them separated and they are in separate rooms now (with litter, food &amp; water). 

I had rubbed them both with the same towel to distribute their smells earlier today. 

What do I do now? I have never seen cats fight like this in my life, let alone cats who have always gotten along.

Our vet didn‚Äôt have any great advice when I talked to her earlier (the female cat is fine by the way, looks like her stomach issue was just a bug, the vet said to just try to redirect them if they start to hiss.

Apprehensive-You-657,1609255740,kmggfv,15,False,1,"My boyfriend and I adopted a three-year-old cat last weekend named Figaro. For the most part he's well-behaved, but he does one thing that drives us nuts... and that is counter surfing.

I have read about ten other posts about cats counter surfing, so I already have some insight on what works to keep *other* cats off the counter, but those things didn't work for my boy. I don't want him on the counter for sanitary reasons but also because I'm afraid he will walk on the stovetop while it's hot. I've yelled at him a few times for doing it before, but I've stopped doing that because I don't want him to fear me. I've been picking him up and placing him next to his cat tower when he does it, but it's hard to focus on working from home when I have to keep doing that throughout the day.

**Things to note:**

\-The kitchen and living room have an open concept plan, so there is no way to keep him out of the kitchen. 

\-Figaro has a big cat tree next to our big living room window, an empty bookcase I don't need but kept so he can jump from the cat tree to a higher spot, and we have bar stools up against the counter/island so he has plenty of spaces to climb and get to higher vantage points (I kept reading posts where Redditors commented that having a stool or table next to the counter solves the problem because the cat can watch you in the kitchen and won't want to counter surf, but he still wants to be on the counter.)

\-I clean the counters constantly (with non-toxic cleaner) and keep food off it. 

\-I spend plenty of time playing with him and petting him, and I work from home, so it's not like I'm gone all day and he is deprived of attention.

\-I give him treats when he just stays on the stools and doesn't walk on the counter... trying that whole positive reinforcement thing.

\-Even if I move the stools away from the counter/island, it doesn't matter because Figaro can jump onto them. He's like a kangaroo.

\-His foster mom let him do whatever he wanted, including scratching up her furniture, so not being allowed to do something is new to him.

**Things I have put on the counters to try and deter him:**

\-Aluminum foil.

\-Double sided tape.

\-Citrus juice.

\-Spray from Chewy that's supposed to keep cats away.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering buying the SSScat Spray Deterrent, but I honestly don't think it will do much good. Figaro is so smart, I think he will learn how to avoid triggering the air spray. I might also try to Scat Mat if all else fails, but again he would probably just learn to walk around it.

kraziechloe,1609226194,km9jvd,1,False,1,"A few weeks ago I adopted a 1yo cat from the shelter. Her background was not quite clear on if she was feral or if her owner simply couldn't keep her and surrendered her. She doesn't seem to mind humans (she lets me pet her, occasionally hold her, sleeps with me, purrs when I pet her, etc). However, most of her ""good"" behavior seems to only occur when it's just me and her in my bedroom and not in the public areas of the house. 

The reason this is an issue is that I stay at my mother's house during breaks from school and she has an elderly cat. The cats have gotten into spats frequently with my cat attacking when the other cat is sleeping sometimes, however fights have been instigated by both cats. These attacks have also caused the elderly cat to have accidents from being scared. We've stopped the cats anytime we notice something about to go down, but they'll act fine sometimes (being in the same area ignoring each other) and then just randomly start fighting. She also doesn't want to be handled when she's outside of my bedroom and will claw/bite until she's put down or left alone.

It's not an option to re-home either cat as mine is an ESA and my mom's cat has been with us for over a decade. We recently got a pheromone diffuser and I put a calming collar on my cat but knowing these take time to work and aren't guaranteed to help I'm wondering what other ideas there are. I'm afraid the cats were introduced too early (saw each other within the first few hours and my cat escaped from the bedroom by the second day), would restarting introductions from ground zero help? It's also difficult to keep my cat confined as she claws the carpet, body slams the door, and cries until she's let out.

For some additional info: my cat was originally sick when I got her from the shelter after a vet visit for infection and a tapeworm dewormer, she went from being calm and sleepy to very hyper (which was not a change I was expecting). I also adopted her when she was underweight (5.5 lbs) and she's now around 7lbs. There have also been a lot of environment changes in the past month: her original location, to shelter, to my college, and to the house. Does she just need time to be settled into an area that's her's? She doesn't seem to be showing signs of being scared when walking around the house (tail and ears up, walking normally, zooming around, etc). I'll only be at the house for another week or so, but I'll be back home for several months in summer.

Honestly she‚Äôs healthy, but she‚Äôs in a dog crate for quarantine for two weeks, then will go to the vet for all of her care and spaying, then my grandma is taking her. She‚Äôs a very petite, beautiful black long hair who is approximately 8 months old. 

I‚Äôm not sure semi-feral is even the right word for her. She was being fed and came when called, but hovered just on the edge of out of reach. If you made a rapid movement in her direction, she‚Äôd run maybe 4 feet away and then stop and look at you. It took me all of twenty minutes to have her walking bravely into a dog carrier to eat some canned food. I think she‚Äôs actually quite a brave cat, which will help. The person who was feeding them did confirm her age, and that she‚Äôs never actually been touched directly.

My first attempt to catch her I just wore thick gloves and tried to reach into the cat house to grab her, but it was just big enough that she could hover just out of reach. She never hissed or growled or scratched. Indeed, she‚Äôs hissed one time. Transferring her from the travel crate to her quarantine crate, I got two pets in while trying to move her along, she hissed once, and then confidently walked into the other crate, walked around a few times and we let her be for the night.

As of today, when I checked her this morning, she had eaten all her dry food and drank plenty of water. I pet her a few times and then she kind of sat up and leaned away from me fearfully, so I totally backed off. Later I brought her some canned food and snuck in a few more pets. As soon as I left she came forward and ate all the canned food and the additional kibble I had brought. Now about once an hour, I go up there, sneak in a few pets, toss her some really yummy treats, and then leave her be. I never push her to changing her body language or feeling like she needs to warn me off.

The first few visits she would hop up and dive into the litterbox as soon as I opened the door to the room the crate is in (I never attempted pets when she did that. I‚Äôd take a seat nearby and read for a few minutes and then leave). Progressively she no long moves away from me or reacts at all as I open the crate door, reach in, and stroke her head, cheek, and along her back. But I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs in total shutdown mode?

TalkToPlantsNotCops,1609052180,kkz65y,2,False,1,"Hello! I have a litter box problem that I can't seem to solve.

My cat is a 13-year-old neutered male. A few months ago he just stopped using his litter box. His box had gotten kind of yucky so I bought him a new one (the exact same brand, style, color). This is something I have done often in the past and my cat never had an issue. But this time, he just straight up rejected the new box and started going on the floor. He started using the floor near the box, but now he'll just go wherever he wants in the basement (where his litter box is located).

I try my best to keep up with cleaning the area so it doesn't become completely horrible. But then one day the basement flooded, which pretty much just spread the urine smell all over. After that, it seemed like the cat decided that entire side of the basement was his toilet.

He did eventually start pooping in the box, but not every time.

He has had some health problems, which I thought might be the underlying issue. He was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He also developed a bacterial infection on his leg which rapidly spread across his whole belly. In the past, he has had frequent skin issues, which seem to come and then disappear quickly. The skin problems have the vet stumped. Vet did a biopsy last week (and now the cat has to wear a cone, which he isn't happy about). I suspect that the pee and poop in the basement aren't helping (my cat also seems to just like hanging out down there in general).

So I decided to deep clean the basement. I scrubbed it several times with trisodium phosphate to remove the top layer of grime. Then when the floor dried I put down an enzyme cleaner and covered everything with plastic. I also got a second litter box, with a litter  that I know he likes. I set it up next to the old one, and placed them both near the bottom of the steps so he wouldn't miss them. I also sprinkled some catnip on the boxes to try and make them more attractive.

And then I went back and found that my cat had peed on the plastic covering the floor, near the litter boxes (but far enough away that he clearly didn't make any attempt to use them). Little dude jumped right over the boxes and peed on the floor.

I am stumped. The vet has checked his kidneys. He doesn't have a UTI. His poo and pee look normal. He isn't as spry as he used to be but he is still able to manage stairs and hop onto furniture just fine (and the boxes are low sided pans that he can easily step into). He eats and drinks normally. There are no other cats in the house. We have a dog but they get along great (they even cuddle) and my dog seems to fuss over him and care for him when he's feeling unwell. 

In the past, he has been unfazed by changes to his litter box (litter type, new box, new placement). He had occasional accidents but never just straight up refused to use the litter box. We've moved multiple times and he's always adjusted quickly (we've been in this house over two years now though). He's never been picky about the cleanliness of his box, either (though now it seems he doesn't want it even if it's freshly scooped).

I know he isn't feeling in the best of health, but he has seemed to be responding well to his insulin (more energy, not as hungry all the time), and he likes his new food a lot. The other thing I can think of is this started to be a major problem around the time the pandemic started, and my husband and I are now working from home, so he's seeing a lot more of us than usual.

Any ideas for how to get him re-trained on the box? Or am I resigned to scrubbing the basement every day for the rest of his life?",CatTraining,Help with cat refusing to use the litter box

All three times it was right after I fed him supper and at some point I go into my room, he follows me in, I turn my back on him, he lunges and grabs onto my leg, and immediately runs away.

Lots of factors contributing to her being anxious overall, baby screaming constantly as she discovers her voice, my playing the piano earlier without a damper pedal, a loud toddler getting excited over Christmas, food was getting low, miscommunication ended up with her not having consistent clean water, litter box was due for a change, everyone suddenly going outside without putting on shoes to talk from the deck to our friend on the sidewalk dropping off Christmas stuff.
The trigger was me rushing downstairs to grab something and running back up the stairs to the front door, which is directly adjacent to her litter box. Before I could get to the door she started attacking my foot and leg, then jumped and crawled up my exposed arm to attack my face. My immediate reaction was to yell at her and try to remove her by the scruff of her neck, which might have worked when she wasn't in fight/flight mode.

i took her to the vet and it was a soft tissue injury and a minor concussion which was a relief since the outcome could've been much worse.

I want to be able to pick her up and put her somewhere else without her ruining my hands. I don't like picking her up in her neck because then she squeals and I feel like I'm hurting her. I'm afraid that that will make her only more aggressive.

It's the only room (besides laundry) that the cat's not allowed in, and I have consistently kept her out of it past the first day she was here + one time she sprinted in when I was walking in/wasn't looking. I tend to stay up waaay later than my roommate and go for a cup of tea around 11 or 12, which is when nothing else can play distraction and I constantly have to try and avoid stepping on this cat because she clings so tightly to my feet and is just bringing herself as bodily close to my bedroom door as possible. 

Any time she tries to follow me, I immediately re-close the door. I've stood at the door ignoring her and trying to wait it out (she just sits down next to my foot, or starts rolling around). I've had my roommate wait outside to try and distract and/or slip into the room while the cat's eating and distracted. (I've wanted to try and train her to not go through the door by having my roommate give a treat if she stays calm/doesn't follow, but she's such a food hungry little bastard that she doesn't pay attention to me at all if there's food nearby, so I don't think she even makes a connection.) 

When I'm not carrying something, I've literally picked her up and moved her somewhere else only for her to fucking race back to my door before I can even turn around. I thought a few weeks of consistently closing the door every attempt she makes would've taught her at some point, but she's nothing if not persistent, and it's very slowly driving me mad. The only thing she's learned is 1. scratching at it will not work, 2. meowing at it will not work (the first few nights she would be at my door for a couple of hours doing both, now she occasionally gives a tap before immediately quitting).

**1.5 years ago:** I've had my girl **Hazel (8yo)** for ~7 years. She's the sweetest, most laid back cat I've ever known - and **has previously been great and super patient when introduced to 2 big dogs, 3 rats, and 3 babies over the course of her life with us.** When my husband begged for the second puppy a little over a year ago, I agreed with the stipulation that I could get another cat. I've always been partial to rescues over puppies/kittens, and he ended up finding a (seemingly) friendly, beautiful black stray in the basement of a job he was working and brought her home. 

**Hazel and Stranger got along surprisingly well for about ~2wks** - they were even cuddling and playing regularly - we never even had to separate them. But then, we had a small dinner party (pre-covid) and I assume **Stranger got stressed from the hullabaloo and went *nuclear* on Hazel.** She spent the next couple weeks straight up trying to murder Hazel every time she saw her - and not just typical cat fights, she was quite literally murderous and was frightening even me. **Hazel never fought back, but was *beyond* stressed and we, ofc, couldn't keep Stranger.** (She is now a happy and helpful barn cat, catching mice and living the good live.) That said, **over a year later, Hazel still shows signs of anxiety** and is more ""affectionate"" with me than she ever was before and has a hard time leaving my side. 

**TODAY:** A couple nights ago, my husband came home with an early Christmas present for me - and the box was meowing. **It was a little black Birman baby, and she is absolutely lovely.** Her mom died before she was fully weened, so she's very affectionate and suckly and talkative and playful. My SO said he thought it might be easier for **Hazel** to bond with a kitten, particularly one looking for a mama figure. I don't know the truth behind that, but it sounds nice.

**I set Poet (~10wks) up in my office for now, and spent some time bonding with her and making her comfortable.** I introduced her one by one with the kids, and she's been great. I introduced her to the dogs one at a time yesterday morning; she got along with one but was a bit nervous and hissy with the pup (tbf he is super obnoxious). I put the dogs and **Hazel** in another room this morning and let **Poet** explore the house. And over the last few days **I've been bringing Hazel and Poet's blankets and toys to one another so they might get used to each others smells.**

This morning, **I decided to introduce Hazel to Poet** after giving her her favorite wet food. **Hazel** could tell something was different in the room, and was acting anxious in my arms. When she heard **Poet's** little squeak she tensed up, and **when she saw her hiding under the chair Hazel became extremely upset.** She clawed into my skin (more to hold on tighter than to hurt me) and started growling underbreath and hissing. She's not one to attack and she didn't even try to bolt - she clearly just wanted me to get her tf out of there. **Poet** just watched curiously and got a little shy.

I'm not sure if **Poet** simply reminded **Hazel** of **Stranger** (both tiny black cats), or if **Hazel** is just cat-averse now... but I feel awful putting her through this anxiety again and **I'm hoping there's a better, more ""anxiety-specific"" approach to comfortably introducing Hazel to the new kitten.**

I'm very protective of my girl and she has always been the fur-queen of this house. If it turns out that she can't get along with **Poet**, this will be the last attempt at adopting another cat. That said, I've really bonded with **Poet** and am really hoping we can make this work. 

For reference, we have a big 2-story home with a no-dogs-allowed basement. Separate litter boxes and separate food areas. **Hazel's** main haunt is my upstairs bedroom during the day, and as I said, **Poet** has been set up in my office while she's not exploring with me - she's still too little for stairs it seems, so hasn't been upstairs or in the basement yet. 

**TL;DR: My older cat (8yo) seems to have developed major anxiety after we brought an cat-aggressive, murderous stray home over a year ago. We're trying again with a new, friendly kitten (~10wks) - and while they aren't fighting, the older cat is *extremely* agitated over it.

  We had a girl living with us that had a male and female cat..long story short they had kittens. Around the time the kittens were born, she got a boyfriend and was never home....leaving the kittens and mom and dad alone in a very small room for days at a time.

  Me and my Girlfriend would go in and try and take care of them as much as possible, but we have busy lives and we assumed the owner would take care of them.

  It came time for the girl to leave and we decided to take in one of the kittens to hopefully give her a better life and more attentive parents.

  I think now from being left unattended in the room, she has no bathroom habits, and when we let her loose in the house we constantly find accidents on our clothes, the carpet etc. We have rubbed her paws in the litter, but don't know much else about how we can get her properly trained and to break these habits so she uses only the litter when she has to go.

  If someone could offer advice, or point us in the right direction of books to read etc to train her. She is adorable, and other than this doesn't really cause any problems. If we can get this behaviour sorted than we will have the best cat anyone could ask for.

Breed: both are domestic shorthair cats

Newly Adopted cat age/sex: 2 y/o male

Elderly cat: 15 y/o female

Both are neutered/spayed

I have been wanting to adopt another cat for several years now. I have always hesitated because my elderly cat does not like other animals at all. Through the years she has become more social with people but is very skittish. The last time she lived with another cat was 3 years ago. My ex bf adopted a cat when we were living together. She hated the cat he adopted. That cat liked to chase her but after she would hiss or swat at him, he would leave her alone or back off. They would never fight. After awhile (few months) they got used to each other and we could leave them alone together and they learned to coexist. After my ex and I broke up and moved away from each other he took his cat and my elderly cat seemed happy.

Well now, I‚Äôve decided to adopt a new cat. I wanted a calm cat that gets along with other cats because of what I knew about my cat. I went to the pet shelter in my area to view a cat I saw posted on their website that seemed to fit what I was looking for. That cat was not wanting to interact with anyone when I got there, so the lady at the shelter showed me another cat that was the one I ended up adopting. I asked about his temperament and how he gets along with other cats and she said he was super sweet, very calm and would be a great fit for a cat like mine (I told her in great length about my cat and previous experience with my ex‚Äôs cat).  

I followed all the rules about keeping them separated for at least 2 weeks, meal time with the door cracked open, leave around blankets so they could smell each other, short introductions and pull back after one gets too agitated...etc.

After the 2 weeks, I decided to see how they would do being in the same room together. It was going fine until the newly adopted cat started chasing after my elderly cat. He looked like he wanted to play with her but she got startled and started hissing at him. He jumped on her and tried wrestling with her and she started screaming and they started rolling around biting each other. They both had pieces of hair fall out. I tried separating them but they got into it again. Once I separated them, I did not let them see each other for a few days. 

Since the first fight, I have been trying to find ways to keep them separated but allowing them to see each other through a barrier. That has been working to some degree however it‚Äôs exhausting. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly needing to split my time with them evenly and keep an eye out. The newly adopted cat also tries to dart out of my room and chase my elderly cat no matter how hard I try to keep them apart. I think they have fought a total of 3 or 4 times now. There‚Äôs never any blood or injuries, thankfully! I check them both each time it has happened. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I adore both of them. I don‚Äôt believe in taking animals back to a shelter and truly he is a good cat. Very sweet, playful, and affectionate with me. But I also feel bad for my elderly cat because she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be stressed out like this.

A year later, I decided to get a third cat to give Artemis someone to play with since Aria pretty much ignores her. That‚Äôs where Chester comes in.

tanistschon,1607492560,k9m2kt,2,False,1,"I adopted a 4 yo female (had a litter of kittens, all adopted out) about 1 month ago. She‚Äôs had issues with sporadically peeing where she‚Äôs not supposed to, biting/scratching, and constantly crying. 

She will turn to biting/scratching very very quickly to communicate she‚Äôs done being petted. She doesn‚Äôt really move away from us or flatten her ears. Her tail is always twitching so it‚Äôs really really hard to tell when she‚Äôs agitated besides when she gets nippy. She‚Äôll scratch even if she has plenty of avenues to move away and was purring a few seconds ago. (She got both my and my roommate on the face so any tips are greatly appreciated)

After peeing on every bed in the house, she was banned from bedrooms. The first few nights she sat outside and cried all night long. While that stopped, she still meows or cries very consistently when we get up in the morning and for a little after we close our doors at night. 

The peeing may be medical but we never were able to get a test done with the shelter and haven‚Äôt found a good vet yet.

Another thing I‚Äôve noticed is she doesn‚Äôt really eat her wet food. We got the brand that was recommended by the shelter and she doesn‚Äôt do more than a few bites.

kashalali,1607395184,k8vneq,10,False,1,"This is a little complex, which is why I felt crowdsourcing possible answers might help more with this situation. I‚Äôm living with my best friend, and her sister has been living here as well. Her sister, K, is difficult to live with for a variety of reasons I won‚Äôt go into here. What‚Äôs important for this is the fact that the cat in question, Sally, belongs to K. Or at least, she feels like she does, and gets very upset and offended when any of us try to intervene. 

Sally was adopted as a kitten from a litter from a stray cat at my parents‚Äô house, and moved to BFs house when she was still a kitten. From what I understand this means she wasn‚Äôt taught manners by her litter mates or mother. Beyond that, K insisted that since Sally is her cat she should get her spayed, but it didn‚Äôt happen until Sally was about 3.  She‚Äôd been in and out of heat MANY times by then, but she‚Äôs never been pregnant. 

The problem we‚Äôre having is Sally‚Äôs extreme unpredictability and tendency for violence. BF and I grew up with cats, we understand warning signs and behavior to look out for in cats, and we know better than to play with our bare hands. But believe me when I say that Sally will be being affectionate and then with ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING turn around and bite us. Not only that, we won‚Äôt be interacting with her in any way and she‚Äôll rush up and bite our ankles. She‚Äôll hop onto someone‚Äôs shoulder for attention and then without warning latch onto their face with claws and bite. 

We play with her often, with multiple types of cat toys, she doesn‚Äôt have access to catnip but it doesn‚Äôt seem to effect her when she does. I‚Äôd like to try a calming collar or vitamins, but it will probably have to be done in secret because of K.

We were discussing possible ways to train her to stop biting and K overheard and got very defensive and angry, she says it seems like we‚Äôre trying to take her cat from her, and went in to say that she thinks we should just let Sally be Sally. So that‚Äôs the second complication to this. 

I can try and consult with my vet about this but I won‚Äôt be able to bring Sally to her to do it - the last time I tried it was to finally get her spayed and K blew a gasket.",CatTraining,Difficulty with biting behavior in a friends cat

Spankyjnco,1607274949,k7xng3,1,False,1,"So I have 2 cats, one is 3 years old, the other is still a kitten, like 9 months old. My first cat, I kind of got him used to early on that he could come outside on the deck with me, and sit on the railing while I put the dogs out, or if the sun was shining we would just go chill for a few minutes out there. This was super easy, and he picked it up pretty quick, and the few times he was trying to get out by himself it was raining, so I let him.. followed by him quickly returning back inside knowing that he had made a horrible mistake. So now, he just chills on the deck with me and all is gravy. 

My  new cat, roughly the same steps taken. She is fine while I take her out, chills does the cat / deck thing... but today my wife was in the doorway holding the door open for a while while talking, and the kitten just walked herself outside, went down the steps and started walking in the grass to go up to my dogs. My dogs were even confused, and I was confused because she ignored us completely and just went exploring. Got her up pretty easily, and got her back inside within seconds. 

Here is the problem, the only difference is my kitten LOVES water. I mean.. daily I have to turn the sink on for her to get under it and play in the water stream for about 10 mins a day, she ends up soaked. She likes to walk into the shower if you open the door for her, she just really likes water, as long as SHE is deciding to go in. So, the rain thing she loved and was not a very good de-motivator. 

I am NOT a cat person, in fact I said I hate cats my whole life, I like dogs. My wife got the male cat after winning a bet with me, and over time we became buddies. He is chill so I'm down.

She is my favorite cat, by far, but definately due to the amount of time i have to spend on her devil ways. Still not a cat person, but I've trained them both the way I know how, which is like dogs. My older cat will come to me, he will lay down if I ask, he will come for ""treats"", he will even run to the door if I ask if he wants to go outside. My 9 month old is the same, but she actually loves our dogs so she does tricks with them like shake/beg/stand up/sit and we have been working on a form of ""pray"" because she naturally did it anyways.

I‚Äôve tried keeping her out of the kitchen with a spray bottle, used cat deterrents at the entrance, clapping at her, putting her in time out on the back porch, playing with her before feeding times, giving her plenty to play with and all in circulation to keep things interesting, changing where we store her food, and changing up her food. Nothing seems to work, and I‚Äôm at my wits end. There have been no other changes in her general well-being, waste in the litter box, or other general behavior. The next thing we‚Äôll try is giving her smaller meals, more times throughout the day. Has anyone had any luck with a very pushy cat?

However an issue that has obviously gotten worse as she has gotten older and bigger is that when she uses the litter box she tends to fling litter all over the place, like to the point of having to sweep after every time she uses it. I have a covered litter box for her (large opening, not super dark), however I also tried a non covered one in case that was the issue, but it was just more of a mess.

Vipatheris,1606879748,k518k4,4,False,1,"Hello all, sorry if this isn't the correct place to post. (Not exactly training, per se.)

I currently live in a 2nd floor unit in an apartment complex. For reasons I don't quite fathom, the layouts of the ground and 2nd floor are exactly the same, so the bedrooms are right on top of each other.

The hardwood floors already creak a bit, but we always walk as gently as we can when moving around after 11pm in the bedroom, as the downstairs neighbors mentioned they could hear us our first week here. That solved the issue.

However, now our kitten is 7/7.5 months old, and around 8ish pounds. When he jumps the 2 feet or so from the bed to the floor during the night, I cringe at the sound every time. The downstairs neighbors knocked on their ceiling the other night after he jumped on and off multiple times in the space of a few minutes.

For most of the night he's good. He understands bedtime, and curls up at the foot of the bed to sleep most of the night, but during the first half hour or so, he usually traipses in and out to go to the litterbox, get water, etc.

He's a relatively anxious cat if he's alone. (The shelter that found him as a baby found him in a bad state of abuse. He's mostly blind, but has settled nicely. He follows us around constantly, and doesn't really like any visitors/strangers.) 

If you close a door to keep him out of a room, he'll sit outside it and meow for hours, so banning him from the bedroom isn't really an option, and would feel cruel.

Is there a way to train him not to hop off the bed so often? 

Or, since I think that's unlikely, does anyone know a good way to soundproof the floor, so he doesn't make as much noise? I was wondering if putting carpet on the floors would help mitigate it at all.

motorgurl86,1606277926,k0kzfa,14,False,1,"So my 5 year old kitty has been with me his entire rescued life, and he has FIC which generally leads to episodes when he is stressed. In the past year, we've been through a lot of changes and several of his FIC episodes, and thankfully he currently has a clean bill of health now (no current FIC episodes, no diabetes, no thyroid issues, no leukemia, nothing out of the ordinary), but his behavior is showing that he's very likely depressed about the new baby arriving in a few months.

He has begun to become very food driven, eating his own food so fast that he throws up and eats it again, then goes for the other cat's food bowl knocking her away and then the dog's food bowl. To solve this, I started feeding him separately in a closed room so that he doesn't speed eat and vomit (nice calm darker area) or bully anyone else while they're eating. It's been working and he even goes to the room on his own when it's time for him to eat.

Then, he started checking everyone else's bowls when he gets out of the room, and jumping up on the stovetop and licking the stove after he eats and after we cook. This is dangerous, so we started cleaning up after cooking immediately and covering up the stovetop area when not in use. This is annoying but is working. Then he started trolling anyone who opens the refrigerator and tries to get in there and constantly persistently under foot hoping he'll trip someone so they drop or spill something and he'll lick it off of the floor. 

To combat this, we started saying no, and spraying compressed air away from him so as not to harm him. It seems to work as long as the compressed air can is in hand, but he's relentless if it's not. Next, he started sneaking up and diving on us and food when we're eating dinner and tries desperately to get onto our plates. Compressed air seems to have worked for this as well. Now he's started climbing up on the countertop and jumping into the kitchen sink to lick both dirty and clean dishes.

This is harder to deal with but we've set up a trap with a beach towel, tinfoil, and painters tape sticky side up to combat this. If we're sleeping he tries to get up there all night. He watches very closely and if we have any vunerability whatsoever he immediately exploits it. Again, I've worked with the vet and he doesn't have any physical health problems aside from the FIC. His weight is excellent for his size, so it's not like he's actually starving, and he has a complete diet with a five star dry and wet food mix vet prescribed.

His fur is shiny, and as long as there's no food whatsoever involved, he's very affectionate and loves attention. He has toys, comfortable cat beds, and multiple cat trees to enjoy (the house is catified), and the vet did prescribe him gabapentin for his FIC or high stress episodes, but currently nothing seems to be helping. Giving him extra attention and playtime doesn't seem to matter if he thinks he can get ahold of food. I don't know what else to do. I'm considering getting one of the motion detection cat deterrents, but a lot of reviews say they just don't work.

My cat Wolfgang is a little over a year old, neutered, not declawed. My bf and I got him mid October, so we've only had him for about a month. He's quite social and outgoing, loves to be around us, and is crazy smart. He has a couple of behavioral issues that we've had to work around though, that weren't mentioned to us at the shelter (I'm assuming they didn't know). Wolf is food CRAZY. I don't know what his past is, the shelter didn't either, he came to them from a different shelter, but I'm assuming he was separated from mom too young or he had to fight for food at some point because he seems extremely food insecure. We've both owned cats before, but neither my bf or I have ever had a cat that acts like this, so we don't know what to do. It seems like the behavior has been steadily getting more intense the more comfortable/bold he gets around us. 

&amp;#x200B;

HIS FOOD: He meows incessantly any time he sees anyone in the household walk into the kitchen (even if it's just to quickly grab a glass of water or something); he's a talkative cat, and his kitchen meow sounds way different than his normal little mews. They're louder and he sounds super desperate, like he hasn't eaten for a week or something. When is actually is feeding time, he goes crazy, spinning in circles, jumping up on the counter to try to get the food, trying to climb your leg to get the food, etc. He eats super fast, like freaking INHALES food. He's always done eating in under two minutes, usually closer to one. We always feed him at the same time twice a day in the same spot, but maybe it hasn't been long enough for him to feel like a routine is established? I want him to know he will always get food from us every day and not to worry. 

We give him treats occasionally in the middle of the day too, via a food puzzle or training him to do tricks (we've taught him to (mostly) sit when we're about to set his food bowl down or give him a treat, which is awesome, so I know he can be trained to be more polite!). We feed him high quality wet food for meals, and usually freeze dried chicken or cat greenies for treats. He isn't underfed, in fact he's filled out just a bit since leaving the shelter. I tried pulling the food bowl away from him once while he's eating, just to see if he growls or becomes aggressive, and he doesn't, but he gets more frantic about eating the food and tries to eat it faster if he sees my hand reaching out. 

&amp;#x200B;

OUR FOOD: When it comes to human food he's even worse, since we won't let him have any of it. Before we brought Wolf home, we established between us that he would never get to eat off of our plates, we wouldn't sneak him bites of food or anything like that, so he's never been deliberately fed human food in our apartment. Wolf will not leave us alone if we're eating, no matter where we are or what we're doing. Every time we open the fridge he runs over and leaps in, trying to find anything he can grab and eat. If we eat in our room and shut him out, he starts frantically tearing up the carpet near the door in an attempt to get in to where we are (we're renting, so we're trying to avoid as much carpet damage as possible - he is generally good about using his scratchers, and it's only if we shut our bedroom door that he flips out). He is totally relentless. We've gently pushing him away over and over (doesn't get the hint), holding our food above our head and saying ""no"", turning away, ignoring him, but he won't stop. 

The other day, I was sitting at my desk eating a salad (literally the most boring salad for any carnivore, no meat or eggs or cheese, just veg, oil, salt, and vinegar) and he was TOTALLY OBSESSED with trying to eat it. He leapt up front of me on my desk to paw at it, so I turned around so my back was to him and continued eating, and he climbs onto my back and up onto my shoulders. I stand up, hold my salad away from the both of us with one arm, and attempt to gently dump him off of me onto the bed with the other, but he held on and tried to climb down my outstretched arm toward the bowl. I had to basically fall partway onto the bed and quickly transfer the bowl from one hand to the other to get him off balance so that he let go. He's also taken a flying leap off my desk while I was standing and holding a bowl of yogurt, spiking the yogurt to the floor like a damn volleyball so he could eat it. Last night, I tried giving him a food puzzle at the exact time I was eating - I had my bowl of food, set his loaded puzzle on the ground, and sat on the couch. He went straight for it, seemed super excited, and I was like, ""yes! maybe we can eat together, this is it!"" It was the hardest food puzzle that this puzzle company sells, and he had found all the treats in under three minutes ( I checked later, yup, they were gone) and was up on the couch trying to pull my bowl out of my hands before I knew what was happening. 

We bought one of those ssscat compressed air motion sensor things, and it will scare him off of the counters when he jumps, but figured out that they don't spray when we're around. He will watch us turn them off when we need to use the counter and then he'll jump up, which, if we're cooking, is exactly what we're trying to avoid. So those are sort of working sometimes, but...sort of not. 

We never hit him or anything, and we try not to discipline him by yelling or spraying water. We don't want him to be nervous around us. I read somewhere that negative reinforcement doesn't really work with cats, so we've been trying to be pretty calm when he acts up and either ignore him or redirect him without reacting too much, but occasionally we'll lose our patience and snap ""hey!"" in a sharp voice or clap loudly to startle him out of doing a bad behavior (only works about a third of the time lol). Not sure what to do differently or if we're going about this wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

OTHER INFO: He still had some extra baby teeth that were pulled a few weeks (maybe a couple months, can't remember) before we got him, and he was neutered fairly recently (I think it's almost been 12 weeks?). Not sure if this is relevant at all.

Wolf is very interested in chewing plastic bags, and will become extremely aggressive if you separate him from them. My right hand is absolutely covered knuckles to wrist of tiny scratches from the past week when I've had to pull him off of a couple of bags. The way he attacks in this instance feels very anxious and frustrated rather than playful or angry, and I know pica is a thing with cats, so I wonder if he has some version of this as well. Not sure if it has to do with food obsession, but I thought I should include it, because he seems to have the same frantic, desperate energy he gets around food that he does when presented with plastic bags. 

We play with him multiple times a day, allow him access to all our spaces (except when we're eating lol) and interact with him/welcome him whenever he comes up to us, so I don't think he's being neglected emotionally. He has many places to sleep, climb, and hide around the apartment too, as well as a whole mess of different types of toys that we try to rotate out so he doesn't get bored.

&amp;#x200B;

We tried to schedule with a vet when we got him in October, but we weren't able to get an appointment until late December - because of covid, our chosen vet is scheduling non-emergency appointments pretty far out. I am of course going to discuss this with the vet, but I was wondering if there are things we should/could be doing until then. He is an affectionate, inquisitive, social cat when food or plastic is not involved, but as soon as he sees a bowl of salad or a garbage bag, it's like he turns into a different cat. 

I'm sort of assuming this is some kind of issue stemming from something in his past, and he's only been with us for five weeks or so, so I'm wanting to be patient with him and help him adjust and learn. I have GAD so I kind of sympathize if he's feeling insecure or anxious, but it's also hard to have to guard my food and try to eat in secret - I feel like my bf and I are starting to eat like Wolf, i.e. as fast as possible. We haven't tried Feliway yet, but I've heard it can be good for chilling cats out, so that's kind of the next thing I'm thinking of trying.

Sorry this was so long, I just really want to give him a comfortable home and I'm worried I'm doing something wrong. Let me know if I can provide more info!",CatTraining,"Food obsessed cat, starting to really disrupt our lives"
Sigma_Phobic,1606104098,jzaff4,4,False,1,"Quick backstory, 
I just got my kitten less than a week ago. He was returned due to being too shy, so I expected to spend about 2-3 weeks with him in hiding. However, he is becoming confident really really fast and even allows me to pick him up and set him to cuddle with us at night for a couple minutes. (I don‚Äôt know why anyone would return him he is a sweetheart). While he is becoming more confident with me and my gf he still is pretty shy, easy to run away under the bed from time to time.

Anyways, I looked online and saw something about clicker training. So I began 2 days ago, I‚Äôll give him 2-3 cut up treats and will use the clicker when I give them to him. This happens 3 times a day before he eats his meals. But today I thought he was ready and tried to get him to sit. 

Sadly I didn‚Äôt catch this issue till now and have been basically rewarding him for the past two days. The issue is I will ask click and he gets the treat pulls back fast and eats it off the floor a couple inches away from me. Not sure what to do here it‚Äôs fine for clicks but when I want him to sit he lifts himself up and eats away from me. I also noticed he does this when he eats his wet food from when I spoon feed. It‚Äôs an issue because 1.makes it harder to get him to take the treat as a peace offering and 2.if it‚Äôs wet food he will lick, steal I big piece, and eat it away from I am covering the carpet in gravy. 

Not sure if I can fix this behavior, or if he is just normally like that. Does he just need more confidence? I thought clicker training helped shy kitties build confidence?

CatNeighbor,1606067822,jz01eh,1,False,1,"We have a 7 m.o. kitten who is fully spayed/vaccinated etc. She loves going outside on her harness and play while we supervise. 

On our street there are a few adult cats that roam the neighborhood. Usually they walk the sidewalk in front or back lane behind our house. There is one cat in particularly that comes around albeit in frequent. We believe it might be the neighbors' cat, although he seems to be mostly outdoors.

In the 5 months we have had our kitten, they only truly crossed paths once. This was when our kitten was \~3 months old and chilling under our car. The neighbor cat tried to cut through our yard without realizing she was there. Our kitten jumped and startled the neighbor cat, ending up with him on his back and hissing before running off into the sunset. Ever since he stuck mostly to the sidewalk/back lane, respecting her territory.

Until this morning. I was shoveling and when I looked over they were sitting 3 feet apart. As I walked closer the neighbor cat kept meowing/chirping and actually came over to me for the first time. His coat is matted and I gave him a few treats which he gobbled up. He started following me around and seemed eager for pets and treats, all while meowing/chirping a lot! Our kitten (still on her harness/leash) stayed within 2-3 feet of him the entire time and seemed quite unsure of the situation. I tried giving her pets and treats too, but the neighbor cat would position himself in between and rub up against me a lot. When they did turn their attention towards each other they often meowed/hissed softly or swiped in the general direction. I did not intervene as I figured I would give them some time to sort things out themselves. They did not get physical with each other, it was all from a few feet apart.

After my lease ended, I moved back home into a larger house and shortly after she turned 1, she has just become very aggressive.

I have a 9yo spayed female who has recently rediscovered her youth with our 7month old fixed male. They tolerate one another, no fights, sleep on the same blanket with butt touches but no cuddles or anything like that. 

Recently, she's been getting involved with the play time when before she was an observer. But she's also chasing off the little one in the middle of it. We also have automated toys in which she will bat him away from it while she sits and watch in. 

I'm wanting to find out of this is her just establishing the social hierarchy or if this is her being rude and aggressive. The little one gets deterred from wanting to play when she's decides she wants to play too. And for sure, the little one NEEDS play time or he keeps my partner and myself up all night and gets into all sorts.

He's a sweet kitten (5months old). But SO food aggressive. He goes wild when I bring wet food into the room. I got an automatic feeder for dry food which helps. And I've been using dry food for training sessions with a clicker to teach him how to sit. And he does good with the dry food and I can see he's learning how to sit now. But with the wet food he forgets everything and goes beserk and will jump on me repeatedly and try and smack the bowl out of my hands. I'm worried about this jumping up as be gets older.

When he does jump, it's so high and be will cling to my shirt and it hurts. So it's hard to ignore. Usually I'll just tell him no and try to hold the bowl high up and far from my body and he will just keep jumping. And I just try to calm him and tell him to sit and won't give him the food until he does.

Basically, whenever my boyfriend or I try and feed them they jump all over us (claw/run up our legs, swat the bowl, try and jump in the bowl, all whilst meowing loudly) and it's becoming really painful. We feed them in separate bowls but it doesn't really seem to matter. We've tried feeding them separately in different rooms but that didn't help either and we've tried squirting them with a water bottle but one actually likes water so it hasn't done anything. We've also tried having one of us hold them while the other prepares the food but they'll try clawing away at the carpet and become erratic.

This carries over to hand feeding them too. Whenever we give them treats they swat our hands with their claws or bite our fingers. I'm not really sure what to do, it's becoming a bit unbearable.

We tried letting him in our bedroom but he would just walk in, meow loudly, and leave about every 20 minutes.

But then he figured out how to open the door and came straight down and started meowing at our door.

We have trained three or four other cats in the past to leave us alone at night and not come in our bedroom. Usually it just took a few nights of ignoring them meowing and scratching at the door.

I have two 10 week old kittens, a brother/sister combo. I was keeping them in a large tiled bathroom at night with food/water/bed/toys and litterbox. They never had any accidents when in the bathroom and appeared to be using the litterbox. When I would let them out in the morning they would go on the tile floor in the kitchen everytime though.

So I bought two more litter boxes and placed them in the corners they kept using in the kitchen, about 5 feet between them.(so a total of 3 litter boxes now). 

I woke up this morning and both new litter boxes had been used with no accidents on the floors, but while I was getting ready for work I witnessed the female digging the tile floor between the litter boxes and pooping. 

Can some give me some insight or opinions on how to help with litter training and/or causes for this behavior?

Doitsu_Hatsuon,1604860290,jqgqs1,1,False,1,"Hey all, 
I've got two cats, one female and one male, both are 1,5 years old. The female cat is the resident cat and she loves to play with her toy mouses and various cat poles, she's very energetic and enthusiastic about play. I'm able to tire her out after a 15min play session and she's good for a few hours. 
My male cat however, well, he's different. I adopted him not quite half a year ago when he was 1. The previous owners did not play with him, or at least they never did anything to build up his stamina. He went batshit crazy when I introduced him to the cat pole, he did tons of high-energy-flying-through-air-jumps and was completely out of breath within minutes. Then he wasn't even panting but more like coughing, it was bad. Vet said it definitely wasn't any problems with his lungs, he's just got no stamina whatsoever. So I exercised regularly with him until he could play for 10 minutes without a Coughing fit. Took me about 6 weeks I'd say. I found out that he really likes small, slow moving things that hide under and between furniture so I put buttons on a pole and we played. But over time he kinda lost the passion to play as every toy I offer he doesn't seem interested and believe me, I got so many of them üôà.  

I don't know how to entice him anymore. He's got a lot of power, he is able to jump really high and with a lot of force but play sessions are a drag now. It's me trying to coerce him to play for about 30 mins and at the end he's just mildly entertained. What else can I try to tire him out more?  

The female cat and him don't really interact with each other much as she doesn't seem to like him ( we are working on it), so there's no play between the two. Every night before bed I make them chase their kibbles around the house. They love it and get really worked up and that's sadly his main energetic outlet for the day. Afterwards he's exhausted and ready to sleep. He's super food motivated, I know that, but I can't keep feeding him throughout the day just to get him to play more :(

However, today after a really great session of handfeeding, I decided I might as well try, as her dew claw was beginning to curl. I‚Äôd done lots of work into letting me touch and manipulate her feet and practicing with a nail dremel, as I had no idea how she would react to clippers and wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt push her too fast.

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get more than 2-3 nails done, but after watching her reactions and rewarding after attempts to touch the clippers to her nail, I just started clipping! I ended up using human nail clippers turned sideways, as it was easier for me to manipulate around her petite claws, and I felt more confident trying with those as opposed to my other clippers. I also have a bunch of experience with trimming cat, dog, and bird nails, so I am very practiced in doing them quickly and safely.

I probably had it a bit easier because she had zero prior experience with nail trims, vs a negative prior experience, so she was a bit of a blank slate.

1: The unfinished ceiling in my laundry room. The cat really likes jumping and resting up in a portion of the ceiling. The issue is that is where my gas line runs through, and she actually uses it as a bit of leverage to get up there. I'm really concerned she will break the line and end up leaking natural gas into our home. I unfortunately cannot keep her out of the room since that is where the primary litter box is or remove access to jumping up there since the fixtures are permanent. Are there any ideas for deterants that I could place up there that wouldn't cause her to panic and possibly damage the gas line?

  


2. I have large speakers mounted to the wall in my living room. Only after rinstalling did I realize that they are big enough for the cats to get on top of, but here's the issue: the mounting brackets will likely break if a cat climbs on top of them. I of course am worried about the speakers, but I am more concerned that the speakers will injure the cats if they fall together since the speakers are around 8-9 pounds. I would attempt the normal tactics of sticky tape or aluminum foil, but I fear it could snap before the training takes hold. I'm keepjng them out of the area for now, but that cannot be permanent.

I am a long time cat owner, having almost always had cats for my entire life (up to 6 at once at one point). I had a visually and auditory elderly cat in the past who was the sweetest thing and never caused any issues. 

However I currently have two fully indoor cats. Both rescues, both males, both neutered. The older one is the most placid and carefree cat in the world. The younger is about 7/8 months old now and is deaf (white cat of course!). We live in a 4th floor apartment in the tropics, we have windows with sliding mosquito netting. He has recently started trying to squeeze in between the windows and the netting, which is pushing the netting (and himself) out of the window. Luckily so far we have stopped him before he or the netting  completely fell out, but we have been trying to train him not to mess around with it at all. 

He has a bazillion toys and we play with him regularly however it tends to happen at the end of the day when he gets his 9pm zoomies. He always has access to food and water and his big step-bro plays with him all the time and gives him lots of love as do we.

So far we have tried a spray bottle when he is doing something naughty, but I'm always dubious and to if that does anything apart from make them scared of us and makes him just more sneaky.

gaydhd,1603510805,jh232y,14,False,1,"*The TL:DR for this is just ‚Äúhow often should cats bite at and groom their nails, especially the back ones‚Äù but my soapbox is below:*


She‚Äôs my first and I have no idea how cats groom. When I first got her I noticed her biting at/chewing her front nails a few times a day. She didn‚Äôt seem to mess with the back ones. I read cats have to remove the outer layer of nail so I attributed it to that and hoped for the best.

A bit over a week after I got her I trimmed each of her nails and put claw caps on her front paws. (I promise I did NOT torture my cat for no reason, I taught her not to scratch the furniture but when she kneads she tears up my bedding and I think it would be awful to train her not to do something that shows contentment. I applied one of the caps as a test first and she didn‚Äôt care, so I went ahead and did the test.)

She hasn‚Äôt messed with the claw caps at all other then to lick the glue off and doesn‚Äôt even seem to know they‚Äôre there. She no longer bites them, but she‚Äôs turned her attention to the back claws and chews and yanks at them at least three or four times a day. Is that weird? Is that obsessive? 

Btw her litter box is clean, it‚Äôs just me and her in the house and I never ever scold her and I play with her at least 15 min/day. She eats, drinks and poops and never hides or bites. Good cat in good health, it seems.

Just freaks me out to hear an awful chewing/ripping sound several times a day and find her with her foot in her mouth, and I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overreacting. 

Was biting the front ones a stress relief thing that she just transferred to her back feet when the caps went on? Should I not have trimmed the back ones? They don‚Äôt look damaged so far, but... she did only just start doing it.

Broeckchen89,1603444101,jgjn5a,6,False,1,"Another kitten issue, and so soon...

My kitten Milkyway loves to hunt and fight, like any baby cat. But she enjoys fighting my hands and feet a little *too* much.

I know it's just play aggression for several reasons. For one, she also loves to cuddle me and actually often grooms the spots she attacked right after. For two, when I signal pain (""YOOOOOOWWWW!"" and gently pushing her off) she gives me this shocked look and is much more careful than before as she goes back to it.

She used to playfight all day every day with her brother and he was completely quiet all the time, never signaling pain. So she never learned to curb hrr enthusiasm.

I've gotten her two kicker toys to redirect her play aggression to those, but she doesn't accept either of them. The simple, quietly rustly pillow kicker (she loves rustling) she bited into but then pushes away. I got her a moving fishy, and she loves *activating* it but then runs off.

Every time I try to put a kicker into her paws as she is trying to claw at my arm or foot she pushes it off and hops away.

She's too young for catnip to work and I don't know what else to do. Despite consequent removal, pain signals, and refusal to let her use my limbs as toys, I'm scratched up all over.

As a sidenote: my roommate and I play with her a lot every day. We have her chase a wand, she has a scratching post with a rattly dangly ball on it, several rattly and rustly toy balls, and I built her a puzzle toy box to forage for some bonus treats.

We adopted a 6 y.o. larger male cat about 2 months ago, and he‚Äôs very sweet, but he‚Äôs definitely outgoing and seems like he had boundless amounts of energy. We have a 3 year old female cat that we‚Äôve had for almost 2 years now, and for about the first month of bringing the new male cat, everything was good, they kind of minded their own business but wouldn‚Äôt avoid each other. 

Lately over the past few weeks or so, the male cat has become increasingly aggressive with the female. He will relentlessly try to go after her and pin her to the ground. She then proceeds to yell out and it sounds like she‚Äôs in pain. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a sexual aggression? They are both neutered/spayed. Even when I deter his behavior, he‚Äôs right back at it! I have to keep him away in a bedroom lately to let him calm down. It‚Äôs just getting worse. 

Has anyone actually found a solution to this problem? I‚Äôve read to try calming collars (I mean he‚Äôs VERY high energy, I rarely see him actually sleep soundly), boat mate or something like that, separation between the cats, etc. 

I‚Äôm so lost. I love both of them and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. The male cat has a vet appointment next month, with COVID I couldn‚Äôt get anything sooner.

Giuseppe_Is_Me,1603290191,jfdroz,2,False,1,"Hello!

Backstory-
I took in a stray cat in very late May of this year, and the vet said shes pregnant and at least three years old. She had her three babies in July, and a little over a month goes by and this behavior started. We(husband and I) would just ignore it, but after a few times we would start to ask her to be quiet, try and get her in bed with us, and my husband would even hiss at her once he was throughly annoyed.

What Soap is doing-
She will start by meowing at the door for about two minutes, then will meow and scratch loudly for as long as twenty minutes before giving it a short break. If let out, she will meow downstairs for at a max 30 minutes, then come back up and meow and scratch like she did to get out of the room to get back in; After an hour she will repeat this if let out and back in.

What I've done and tried-
When I looked it up originally, most things online said it was her trying to mate again, and so we waited and tried to tough it through until she could get fixed, which was confirmed by our vet. During the wait, we tried to completely ignore her, which was hard. After trying this, it only halfed her behavior. I also tried to keep her awake during the day, and tried to up her playtime, but this didn't seem to have much effect.

She was fixed about two weeks ago, and for the first half of the week she was healing, no behavior! Awesome! But, of course, she started again. My husband is at his wits ends and will now lock her in our closet and close the bathroom door the dampen the noise from her. (We have a large walk in closet connected to our bathroom, and I put toys, a litter box, food and water in there.)

Extra information-
She is free fed dry food, and will get wet food after a hard play session every other week. I play with all the kitties for at least 30 minutes a day, but normally around 1-2 hours, not counting self play or playing with each other. We found a home for the kitten that we and our roommates aren't keeping on Monday of this week. We typically keep our and the roommate's kitten in the room on our bed at night. (theyre a safe size to sleep with us and we don't force them) Soap used to sleep in bed with use too until she had the kittens.

So I am now the mother of an adorable little kitten lady named Milkyway! She is 8 weeks old, settling in marvellously and we have great chemistry!

She was definitely given to me in part as an emotional support animal, and she already really stabilizes my mood and lessens anxiety through her sheer presence. (I have clinical depression and ADHD)

However, I've also wanted to look into some training a bit closer to service animal tasks. Naturally not quite as involved, but I basically want her to be able to spot some warning signs and know how to best respond to them.

One of my worst problems is that I struggle with leaving the house. I am harness training Milky already, to which she responds really well! We live in a city but have a gorgous courtyard in the back where I want her to be able to climb, sniff and play on her leash eventually.

I was wondering if there is a way for her to learn the signs of me clamming up before trying to go out. If so, can she learn to nudge me into it? It would be playtime for her, too.

I've also begun very simple clicker training and she already perfectly responds to the command I have for ""come here!"".

danger_nooble,1602621659,jalz11,7,False,1,"**TL;DR:** Formerly sedentary and fiercely independent 8 year old Bengal has suddenly gotten incredibly co-dependent and aggressively noisy in our new living situation. I can't focus on work!

My 8 year old (neutered) Bengal and I have always lived in smaller city apartments together, but just moved into a new studio apartment a month ago. He's always been independent and sedentary, and spent much of his early life being alone for long periods of time while I was away at work and otherwise. In our last living situation, he practically wanted no attention from me or my ex bf at all and would *never* cuddle with us. Now that it's just us in a new place, he has gotten incredibly co-dependent, wild and has started meowing incessantly at the front door all day long.

When we moved in, I started taking him on walks again a couple times a week (something we used to do earlier in his life). This must have awoken something in him, because he started getting incredibly sexually aggressive with one of his toys, and has started yowling at the door any time he hears activity in the hallway, which is often considering our door is literally in the lobby and across from the leasing office. He even SPRAYED our last walk, something he's never done once before! I thought longer walks would be helpful, but he immediately starts yowling at the door when we come back in. 

I've tried all the behavioral tactics in the book. I haven't taken him on a walk in over a week, hoping he will forget the outside world exists and forget what he is meowing at. I replaced the hump toy with more prey-style toys (tiny mouse, a little ball that rolls around on its own, and one of those floppy fish). I don't engage/make eye contact/yell when he meows and strictly give him attention and play time when he's quiet. He has a great bed spot in our corner windows with an awesome view of birds. I got him a hummingbird feeder for the window and we get visitors often. I even have the laptop across from his bed in the window playing bird videos on YouTube constantly. He isn't interested in any of it! He's just so fixed on that front door and what's going on on the other side.

I would get him a little brother or something, but it's too much of a gamble that I'd have another troublemaker on my hands. Our space is just too  small for another pet and a second litter box.

I'm at my wit's end, y'all. It's now been two weeks of this. I am working remotely during the pandemic and I absolutely cannot focus on my work and it is horrendously embarrassing during meetings. Am I on the right track here and just need to hold out? Is there something more I can do?",CatTraining,Bengal yowls at apartment front door all day long
nikkigrover2,1602612511,jaiwht,3,False,1,"Hi. I just adopted a 3 y/o female cat over two weeks ago and we get along great. The shelter told me she was surrendered because ""she gets too excited when fed,"" but the shelter said they had no problems with her eating so they assumed her previous owners may not have been feeding her enough (although she is a healthy 10.8 lbs). 

However, now I think the previous owners may have told the shelter that she gets too excited when PET, not fed.

Here is an example of this which just happened:

I came home after being out for an hour, and she greeted me by rubbing her head and body against me and just head-butting into my leg. I get down and put my hand in her face and she guides me on her hand. I also pet her whole body and go up to her tail (which she seems to love, but also could be what overstimulates her). Anyway, I get up because I have to go wash my hands and she follows me and uses her paws (claws are usually extended but they weren't this time) and her teeth to get a hold of my leg.

Even earlier today, I was petting her chin and cheeks and she opened her eyes and they were fully dilated and staring right at my fingers, which I took as her about to pounce. She shows no tail thrashing or flicking signs. Usually her dilated pupils signify that she is about to get aggressive.

None of her nips hurt nor pierce skin, and usually I move away quick enough so she doesn't actually make contact with my hand. 

I've tried to give her a stern ""No!"" each time but I've read that doesn't really help. I also gave her a good play session right before I left for the hour. Yesterday I gave her two good play sessions. I also cannot get another cat because I'm a full-time law student and I live in a small one-bedroom apartment by myself. 

Is there any other method that anyone's used?

This is also my first cat and it's just me and her in the apartment all day together. We get along great except for when she gets overexcited and into prey mode. I've bought her an array of toys so I can figure out what she likes (I have a ball towers, a teaser wand, laser, an actual tunnel, bunch of confetti balls and balls with noise inside, and some catnip toys -- she loves the teaser wand so I use that for our play sessions).",CatTraining,New Cat Gets Overstimulated Easily

I've also inadvertently taught him 'just wait' to wait without pestering me when I have something he wants, which I'm going to work on reinforcing for more general situations.

We got them (female, littermates) three months ago. They get wet food 2x and dry food 1x a day. **From the start, one would go for her sister's food as soon as hers is done, resulting in both of them inhaling their food in 10 seconds.** 

We added water. We set their bowls far apart. We've tried two different kinds of slow feeders‚Äìthey're smart and found ways around them‚Äìand are now trying a third. 

The smaller, 5 pound kitten‚Äìlet's call her Thing 1‚Äìis particularly obsessed. She doesn't just gobble her food in 10 seconds. **She'll steal food right off your plate and drag it behind the couch in the blink of an eye.** Thing 2 is more the persistent type who will try to sneak a bite no matter how many times you relocate her or distract her. 

**There are no underlying issues.** Their vet says they are perfectly healthy and getting the correct amount of food.  Now, we tried clapping, hissing, and coins in a jar. A gentle spritz of water was the only thing that kept them off the dinner table, and they are better behaved around human food. But now they're teenagers and will just try again and again.

The worst part about their food obsession is **not being able to do \*anything\* in the kitchen without them begging for food**, biting your leg, or crowding you. I've almost tripped and fallen multiple times this way. We ignored them when they did this and praised them when they acted appropriately. It did nothing. 

We started putting them in a different room at feeding time so they wouldn't associate us in the kitchen with food, and the food would just \*appear\* at the same time each day, but they still begged in the kitchen. And **they'd go so crazy in the bedroom waiting that they'd try to dash out at the sound of the knob turning and would sometimes hit their heads running at full speed.** 

So a few weeks ago, we installed the tallest (41 in) baby gate that we could use. Thing 1 jumped over it in about 3 seconds. Put double sided tape between the bars and on top so they'd stop, and only opened the gate at feeding time. This worked for a while.

**Now, not only do they meow nonstop for food‚Äìearlier and earlier each day‚Äìthey leap onto the gate at the slightest \*hint\* of their food bowls being picked up.** They don't care that it's unpleasant and their fur gets caught in the double sided tape. 

**Frankly, they don't give a f\*ck.** No matter how much we pick them up and drop them outside the gate, they keep doing it. I've spent 20 minutes before trying to associate leaping over with delays in getting their beloved pat√©‚Äìand sitting and waiting with getting the food‚Äìbut it doesn't work. They know the 'sit' command for treats, but won't 'sit' for wet food.

* I've had him since he was 7 weeks and he's been socialized with people and other cats the best I could.

* He's never displayed this aggression with any other person. The only time he's bit me is when I've over pet him and he's over it.

I'm hoping it's just stress from the move and him being a bit of a teenage cat. Any advice would be greatly appreciated though. Although my situation with my parents is temporary I would like our stay for the next few months to be a little more pleasant.

But here's the problem I have with her. She always ALWAYS, no matter how much litter I put in the litter box ( I'm at close to 5 in now) she always digs until she hits the bottom of the litter pan before she poops.

beardedbrozzer,1601677378,j44bf0,20,False,1,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a new cat owner that recently adopted an  one year old cat. I got several types of dry food to see which one she prefers. She takes two three small bites of what I pour in the bowl and then meows non stop asking for wet food, or simply the food we eat at the dining table. It's coming to a point where she just jumps on our table when we're having lunch. She can smell it from a good distance and comes running every time she hears sounds from the kitchen.

My friend offered me some of his cat's dry food (different brand-high quality) to see if she'd end up liking it. I gave her some and she took three bites and walked away. Now I can't risk buying brands like whiskas or Purina because im scared she would waste those too. They're not cheap either. 

When I give her things like canned tuna or chicken she empties the bowl in seconds. Obviously. I know cats love wet food. But I can't afford to switch her diet to this alone. I really thought this would be much easier, I had no idea it would be so hard to get her to eat her dry food. 

She has a fresh bowl of water everyday, she also drinks enough water so this isn't an issue. Also, all the wet food is also giving her diarrhea. Her pee and poo both stink.

Hello! I have a bit of a conundrum and could use some helpful  advice! 

I had a cat (fixed female)  for 4 years before introducing a new Savannah kitten (fixed male). We introduced them to each other mostly according to procedure, but she took a long time to tolerate the new exotic addition. 

Now the Savannah is full grown and much bigger than my original cat who is tiny and light even for a regular house cat. 

He plays too rough with her and there is a lot of stress between them. He often invades her personal space which makes her growl and hiss. He pounces on her, pins her down and she shrieks like a back-alley cat. She‚Äôll be sleeping somewhere cozy and he‚Äôll chase her off to take her spot...This stuff happens almost every day! She‚Äôs fiesty though and also chases him around playfully but he always takes it too far, probably not realizing his own strength. They‚Äôre not very good friends...although they sometimes sleep close to each other.

Now the savannah breeder I bought him from has another litter of F5 kittens available who are his half-siblings. I had the crazy idea that maybe if we get another Savannah then they would match each other‚Äôs energy and give my older house cat a break.

All this to say, I would appreciate any tips on how to mediate the two cats I already have, and wether adding a third would help or just create even more stress.

6 months old cat loves wet food and occasionally eats from the bowl of dry food. 4 years old cat loves dry food and eats some wet food. So far we put 1-1 bowl of wet food for them. They get the same food, no difference. However the younger cat usually eats his portion fairly quickly most of the time, then he goes on to eat what‚Äôs left of the other cat‚Äôs wet food which he left there once he got enough This usually means he eats 1.5x the portion... which is not good in the long run, since we don‚Äôt want him to get fat.

It's been really good for both of us. The only trouble I run into is when something makes her nervous. Neighborhood dogs across the yard, kids running, loud noises from the garbage truck, car sounds... if she feels unsafe, she simply turns and briskly walks back to the house. Good! But if she gets really scared, like a kid or dog running at her? She bolts. And when she runs I can't keep up with her and the lead yanks her, causing her to fall, and that scares her too.

Vipatheris,1600489900,ivlsz3,17,False,1,"My kitten/cat (He's currently approaching 6 months old.), has recently become obsessed with my toilet. 

He continously tries to stand on his hind legs &amp; place his front legs on the rim, until I shoo him off or hiss at him. He has jumped onto the rim sometimes as soon as I lift the lid, taking me by surprise. Everytime this happens, I've managed to grab him before he goes into the toilet, and place him out of the room, before shutting the door. 

My gf and I will typically leave the bathroom door open if it's just the two of us at home. It's gotten to the point where I now keep the door closed about 95% of the time, unless I know he's asleep or preoccupied.

Tonight, as I went to the bathroom before coming to lie in bed, he ran full tilt into the bathroom as soon as I opened the lid, and leapt straight into the toilet while I was starting to pee.

I caught him in midair with one hand, but he dipped his front paws into the bowl before I got him.

Does anyone have tips on how to mitigate his interest about getting inside the toilet? My gf suggested maybe we just let him jump all the way, to see if he realizes he doesn't like it, but in worried about reinforcing his behavior.

We've had him since he was a kitten - and he was always very food-obsessed - to the point where he would steal the other cat's food and having to limit how fast he can eat his food do to not chewing it and vomiting fairly quickly after eating. This still happens - but my mom has figured out a decent system for this after much trial and error.

Starting at about when he was 1 year old he started becoming destructive when he was hungry - particularly at 3-6 in the morning while everyone was sleeping, I'm assuming so someone would get up and feed him.

Ni_Go_Zero_Ichi,1599984299,iruaz3,16,False,1,"**First, some backstory** (skip the next two paragraphs if you‚Äôre in a hurry): 

14 months ago I adopted Calvin and Hobbes, two male kittens from the same litter, and brought them to live in my suburban ground-floor studio apartment. From very early on, they exhibited anxious and troubling behaviors. Hobbes, the more assertive and dominant of the two, was incessantly restless, jumpy and demanding: he would constantly nip, nudge and whine for attention, never seemed to be satiated by any amount of vigorous play, and would easily get startled and slash me deep enough to draw blood. He tore up my apartment, woke me up every night, tracked dirty litter everywhere, destroyed or ignored new toys and furniture I bought him, and eventually started peeing on my laundry (even when I tried to seal it in a hamper). Calvin, meanwhile, was the runt of his litter, submissive and dependent; he was slow to develop physically, went through phases of lethargy and undereating, was terrified of strangers, cried horribly when separated from Hobbes for even a moment, and would even attempt to nurse on his brother for many months longer than any kitten should be nursing in the first place. Once they were about a year old, I started to let both cats play outside every day, and for a while their behavior seemed to improve dramatically.

Over the course of this summer, Hobbes gradually stopped coming home. He stopped voluntarily coming indoors when invited, and when I brought him inside myself he would ignore his food, very quickly get restless, and whine and tear at my window shades trying to go back out. He would disappear for several days at a time, then a week, then two weeks, and finally he just vanished. He had a collar the last time I saw him, but he and his brother have both managed to get rid of multiple collars in short time. I have no idea if someone took him into their house, or if he‚Äôs living outdoors halfway across the state. They‚Äôre both microchipped for recognition by vets or animal control, and I put out a missing notice for him, but I‚Äôve heard nothing. Hobbes made it clear he no longer sees my apartment as his home; I‚Äôve pretty much given up on him.

‚Äî**IMPORTANT STUFF STARTS HERE**‚Äî

Ever since Hobbes left, Calvin has been inconsolable. He was extremely attached to his brother and loved to snuggle and play pretty much constantly. He no longer plays with his toys indoors or explores and chases animals outside for fun. He ignores the cat furniture in the apartment as well. He never seems calm or sits still; he just paces frantically back and forth around the apartment, crying, screaming, and nudging me urgently to get my attention (but doesn‚Äôt calm down when I pet him). Every night he shows up on my front porch and whines to come inside, but the second I close the door behind him he *immediately* starts screaming to go back out and will not stop for hours. Sometimes it gets so bad I have to shut him in the bathroom all night; even when I don‚Äôt, the second he sees I‚Äôm awake in the morning he will start crying again until I let him out. I don‚Äôt know exactly where he goes outside, but mostly he seems to just be roving around the block or sitting by the porch or parking lot, examining every rustle in the bushes to see if it‚Äôs his brother and whining/yowling at me when I pass by. In the past week, he has even stopped touching his food and water. (I found out a neighbor‚Äôs family had been mistaking him for a stray and feeding him, and I‚Äôm afraid it might still be happening even though I asked her to stop.)

The local vet prescribed him an anti-anxiety medication that just knocks him out for the evening. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even do that; he‚Äôll sleep for a couple hours, then wake up and start pacing and yowling again. Since he‚Äôs stopped eating his food, I‚Äôve had to start force-feeding him the pills every night. Every few days he seems to exhaust himself naturally and rest for a while, or to calm down when I hold and snuggle him, but by and large he seems to be distraught and nervous almost every minute of every day for going on two months now.

I truly don‚Äôt know what to do. I live alone and I‚Äôve never owned cats before these ones, so I don‚Äôt have a clue what is and isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behavior. I can‚Äôt sleep at night, feeling like I‚Äôve failed as a pet owner. All of my friends who own cats are baffled when I tell them the problems I‚Äôve had with mine.

My girlfriend and I just recently adopted a cat, and soonafter adopting, my girlfriend realized that she seems to have picked up a cat allergy sometime in the past few years. (She was fine around cats growing up which is why we adopted in the first place) We‚Äôve really grown to love our new cat (he‚Äôs 10 months old), and we‚Äôve allowed him in the bedroom to lay on the bed and roam around freely at night. He never causes any trouble at all in our bedroom, and he‚Äôs the sweetest little cat I‚Äôve ever seen. Problem is, my girlfriend‚Äôs allergies are really severe whenever she wakes up due to all the cat dander floating about in the bedroom air and on the sheets/pillow. We decided that the best solution for us to keep him and deal with my girlfriend‚Äôs allergy at the same time would be to just have the bedroom be a cat-free zone. Our cat really doesn‚Äôt like this and keeps meowing and scratching at the door at night. It seems really unfair as he hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong at all and is probably confused as to why we‚Äôre treating him like this.

Am I being too sensitive? Will he get over it? Is there a possibility of him acting out (getting into garbage or pooping where he‚Äôs not supposed to) because he feels he‚Äôs being treated unfairly? I‚Äôve never dealt with something like this and would love some opinions and advice

Also, would having a HEPA air purifier in the bedroom possibly make it so that we can continue letting him in our bedroom?

He is cuddly &amp; affectionate but he can also be a bit of a psycho. Without warning, he appears from nowhere, pupils dilated and attacks relentlessly, biting &amp; scratching. We say 'ow' loudly, we've tried hissing at him, we pick him up and put him away from us, but he keeps coming back.  We've tried ignoring him but it's impossible as he does it so hard.

Staff said that she was very shy around people and half feral, but loves people now etc. Didn‚Äôt disclose the reason she was returned previously, although we are pretty sure it‚Äôs because of her behaviour she exhibits in a home. Long story short, once we took her home she now has a very different personality. 

It took her days to warm up to us, we kept her in one room. She escaped, and hid in the house for over 3-4 days without eating or going to the bathroom. We thought she had gone outside somehow. Found her, then put her in my room, she escaped again after a few days and hid for about 5 days, though we could hear her at night. Figured out she was hiding behind the ceramic tub we can‚Äôt move, and we let her go for another 2 weeks or so thinking she would eventually start coming out. 

She would not come out, we couldn‚Äôt pet her, brush her, hand feed her because of how she hid. Eventually got her out, and put her back in my room where she‚Äôs been for the past month. 

She still does not trust me 100%, but she trusts me more than anyone else in the house. She has bit me pretty hard a few times trying to pet her or pick her up. 

I‚Äôve been giving her treats and enticing her to come out from under my bed, but it only really works at night. She can be really affectionate and really playful every once in awhile. 

My worry is this: I can‚Äôt let her out of my room otherwise she will hide in places we can‚Äôt get to. (We will be moving in a few months to an apartment, hopefully then I can give her the entire area to roam).

When I first got her she was found in a driveway so I imagine she is used to the great outdoors being her litterbox. Anyway I was able to get the concept into her head that she's supposed to pee and poo in the litterbox pretty easily, but now she poops outside of it and only pees in it. At first it was pooping AND peeing outside of the box but now it's just pooping (and peeing on the bed sometimes...) 

I took her to the vet, they did bloodwork and a urinalysis, she was almost perfectly fine except for maybe a few extra white blood cells in her urine. She got a round of antibiotics and finished them, and she's been tested for worms twice so I know she's parasite free. She had loose stool for quite a while (one of the main reasons I took her to the vet) but the vet didn't know what was causing it. I began mixing pumpkin into her food and it cleared up not long after that.

Now her current status is: She poops outside of the litterbox (mostly in the closet it's kept in, sometimes directly outside of the box) and pees in the litterbox. That is, unless we leave her unattended in our bedroom, she will pee on the bed. I think this is just a territorial thing?

Mahoushi,1598466543,ih4edk,8,False,1,"I was there at the time of the kittens birth, there was a health scare when he was about a month old, his brother needed critical care at the vet for a week and I stayed at home and looked after this guy (following vet advice). When he was about 4-5 months old, my sister and her partner took him home to take care of. That was two years ago.

My sister has experience with animals and has rescued some abandoned puppies and kittens in the past, but her (now ex) partner never had a pet before.

I don't know how they were with him apart from the fact that they encouraged him to rough play with their heads and didn't teach restraint, and babied him (I've seen a video of him meowing from the top of a fridge or something until sis's ex-partner went over and escorted him down on a cushion).

I saw him for the first time last summer. He was doing chewing motions (his brother, my cat, does this when rough housing with his companion cat) and sounds at the air and seemed agitated with me so I gave him space, after a while (when he seemed better) I tried to coax him with treats and slow movements, he bypassed my hands and attacked my face, drawing blood to the left of my nose in a deep scratch. Later he did similar with my dad but he leaped up on him and clawed pretty severely at my dad's face, the cuts were small but deep enough that one dripped a little blood.
There was a further incident, he pursued me into another room, yowling at me, and leapt at my leg and shredded it. I had a long, deep gash down my calf and a bite on the side of my knee. I was wearing jean trousers so it wasn't as bad as it could have been. I haven't seen him since. I gave my sister training book (was more persistent with the one that helped me most and insisted she keep it) and urged her to read them and train her cat before it's too late.

My sister left her partner and moved nearer to family with this cat and there has been some more incidents: he clawed my mother's head open as a way to say hello to her (he wasn't being aggressive like he was to me and my dad a year ago) and she needed stitches, and he attacked my sister's arm after she had a shower‚Äîwe theorise he did this because she didn't smell familiar to him anymore, my cat gets all funny (like on catnip lol) after I've put perfume on so it made sense to me that perhaps his response to her showering was more heightened because they had just moved.

Now everyone is scared of this guy, he's been quarantined in the room my sister was supposed to stay in at my parents place although my mum has been playing with him through the door crack, and keeping him fed and stuff. Not not about my sister but I know she won't abandon her boy and will be doing what she can to ensure he doesn't feel alone but she no longer feels safe with him. My mum has has her finger bitten at some point and once again needed to go to hospital to have it looked at.
I live alone so I still haven't seen this cat since he attacked my leg a year ago but I'm worried his actions has sealed his fate. I feel upset and betrayed because I essentially hand reared this little guy when he needed the home care as a ktiten and I spent a lot of time with him. I kept the other cat because it was a concern that he'd be the handful and need extra care after the traumatic vet experience (after the week away he was very heightened and aggressive so I had to spend a lot of time earning back his trust and affections), his brother was sweet, playful, and affectionate before he left.

He's still not neutered and I have urged my sister to get him neutered, asides from that I'm not sure what they've done to make him such a scared and aggressive guy and I'm not sure what advice to give to help him, I don't want any of my family lose an eye! He narrowly missed getting me, my dad, and my mum's eyes out! Any advice bar taking him to a no kill shelter and giving up on him? He's difficult but he's still our family too. We live in Glasgow (Scotland).

_______________
I adopted my boy 3 months ago, when he was 8 months old.  He was raised in a cat shelter and exposed to lots of people during his development.  Then he was adopted by people who dumped him outside and ignored him.  The neighbors fed him, and eventually convinced the owners to return him to the shelter where he was raised and i got him.  When i got him he'd been at the shelter for 2 weeks and was emaciated, incredibly poorly groomed, and had every parasite.  He was VERY friendly, but didn't know to play with people, respond to a summons, tell you how he wanted to be pet/handled, etc.  (it was weird, tbh)  We've worked that stuff out.
____________

He's a product of that upbringing.  

When i got him he'd just yell in to the void whenever he was distressed.  (He's much better now, i've taught him human-cat communication)  

Unlike a rescued feral, he's supremely confident.  He doesn't react to dogs, lightning, loud noises... anything.

He immediately made friends with all the neighbors.  (they love him, and now they flag me down to chat, which is great)

When he's inside he's always at my side, but never in my lap.

He's not motivated by rewards, like an adopted feral.
_______

So the issue is that i don't have much influence over his behavior.  He doesn't respond to rewards, doesn't startle, and while he likes me... that doesn't have much value.  So there's some behavior changes i'd like to encourage, but i don't know how.

He's still nocturnal.

He runs up and hollers at everyone walking down the street.

Here is my issue m: Jack has woken me up in the morning by meowing or whining almost every single day since I adopted him a year and a half ago. I keep trying things I read online and on this sub, but I'm at my wits end. 

I've tried to help this a few ways, one of which is reducing his overall energy with stimulation. Jack has always been a really high energy cat, so I picked up a nightly play routine for both cats. We play for 30-45 minutes right before bed, and then they both get dinner. Every other day he also gets a 20 walk outside on a leash and harness. I've picked up clicker training, but it hasn't really clicked for him yet, so I'm still working on that. 

By the time morning comes around, he wants to play again and starts vocalising for me to feed him or pay attention to him. I've already invested upwards of an hour every day to play with him, I'm not sure what else I can do.

He understands that bedroom is for sleeping/chilling (no toys inside, etc) and when me and my GF are there he usually lies next to us and just enjoys our company or sleeps or sits in the window and watches traffic, birds, bats, etc.


Almost every week however he has 1 or 2 days when he is chill for the whole day, we have playtime, then around bedtime he starts to act like the devil possessed him. Initially we thought it is because we both leave for work and he is alone, but yesterday we were both home all day, played with him, he slept with us in the afternoon and overall he was a good boy. He went to sleep around 6pm, woke up at 8pm, we played with wand toy, then he got bored and played alone. After this it seemed like he is suddenly scared of us. Wide pupils, hiding around the apartment (under bed, chairs, bathroom, etc), when we went near him he ran away all across the apartment. Whenever we tried to pet him (let him smell our hands, etc) he instantly bit and scratched us so we left him alone.


We went to bed, started to watch a movie then he came running into the bedroom and attacking both our hands and feet and faces. We used spray bottle to stop him, he ran out, came back, sat down next to us like he is relaxed now. But once our ankle was visible he jumped them like he was hunting a prey. We turned off the TV, started to fall asleep then he attacked us again. We locked him out of the bedroom which made him meow and scratch both doors for hours. He always sleeps with us in the bedroom.

They only play with each other but obviously prefer the bedroom as the setting of their chase as they like to be in the same room as us.

Zorukia,1597090075,i7ch4g,23,False,1,"So, to start off: I have three kitties. 

Pumpkin is a sweet angel, perfect on every way. He's very sweet to me, never bites, never uses his claws. We got him outside as a starving/dying feral kitten at 9 weeks and he has never acted like it. Neutered at 4 months. Now 2 years old, XL orange tabby.

Phoenix is the typical young girl kitty. Rambunctious, bullies her older brothers and very very playful. Spayed before we got her, at 5 months. Adopted her from a shelter. Now 1 year old, small gray tabby.

And then... There's Pharaoh. He's the eldest. 3 years old, found outside at 7 weeks, neutered at 4 months. He is a hunter if there ever was one, but hasn't been outside since he turned 2 due to my belief in not allowing cats outside. (It's unhealthy and I don't have the money to pay for the constant injuries and illnesses that come with being an outside cat.)

All of my cats have proper vaccines, have been eating the same expensive brand of healthy cat food, and get treats often. My spouse and I treat them all very nicely, even getting consent before picking them up or petting them.

Now, my two kitties are angels. But then there's Pharaoh. He was a feral kitten and will always be feral. He is aggressive. Not to his siblings, not to my spouse, but to me specifically. 

For example; 

1. If i get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, he charges and bites my leg. He will attack me, drawing blood nearly every night. I have bad eyesight and my room is pitch black at night, but even with lights on, he'll still attack. 
If he's in a bad mood in general, i'm the one that he harasses. He always goes to bite/claw my leg any chance that he gets depending on his mood.

2. He also yowls and meows loudly throughout the night and makes it impossible to sleep, especially with the fact that he knows how doors work and shakes the round door handles trying to leave.

3. We stopped letting him leave the house at 1.5-2yrs(can't remember exactly when). His yelling at night and shaking of doorhandles was bad before that, but it's gotten even worse now and he's gotten more aggressive with me in particular.

4. Plus, our cats free-feed off of textured, flat platters on the ground. If we put too much food, he gobbles and promptly vomits multiples times per day, so we had to lessen the amount of food we put down. He also gulps water until he gets so full that he vomits as well. 
We aren't sure why he does this, but our vet says he is a very healthy cat. He has never had any health issues. 

5. If one of the platters is empty or near-empty(just one, doesn't have to be both), he will march over to something that we cherish or use often (usually a cell phone), and chew on it until he is either noticed(and pushed gently off of the table), or until it is sufficiently destroyed. Then he lays down, satisfied, and meows innocently. 
Why does he do this?
He has destroyed many-a-glass screen protector, and chewed up my glasses/phone cases like a teething puppy. 

6. During a hurricane two years ago, when he was an only child, our house flooded and he was moved to different rooms before we noticed the flooding was everywhere. He got wet and felt trapped and scared, so now I believe he may have minor PTSD from storms as he gets very aggressive and yells loudly during any kind of low-pressure event or storm with thunder. I try my best to keep him calm/happy, but he will still get aggressive and bite me/yell. 

*They all have many toys, multiple cat towers, hammocks, windows with direct sunlight, and music playing to calm them(which works) when there are storms/loud stressful days.*

I have two kittens who are 3 months old. I have had them since 8 weeks. I want to train them to be cuddly and snuggly cats, I want to train them to stay off certain counters and by my tv. Also i noticed when I call their names or snap my fingers they always come running to me, so I figured I would like to train them to come to me all the time. I want them to be able to like brushes and nails trimmed. Also I want to walk them on leashes or something. My other cat use to go outside until the age of 10 but that was when our city wasn't really a city. So I want to be responsible with them outside. Was thinking maybe a cat tent. 

I have been doing reading and trying things but I just want to know if it's worth trying to train them or if cats will be cats. 

My other cat who passed was the Queen of the house. As she aged she didn't care about plants, toys, counters etc. After about 13 she just did her own thing. Training her would have been pointless as a younger cat from my memory as well. She really did rule the house and do what she wanted. 

I don't want that with my two new fur babies. I want some control of the house. 

I was wondering if a dog clicker would be useful for calling them, and giving treats. They already respond to a snap somewhat. 

I have tried double sided tape for counters and it just doesn't seem to deter them. I am going to try tin foil but I dont expect it to work. I don't want to use a spray bottle, I really want these guys to be little cuddle buddies. So I'm not sure what to do for the counters and tv. 

For the nails, they don't really like it right now. I can usually get a paw or two while they sleep but I suspect that will not go well when they are older. What has worked for you guys for nails? 


The brushing they don't seem to mind but I am worried when they get older they will not be interested. I have been keeping at it though.

I'm not sure what to do for going outside. They aren't done growing so I haven't bought harnesses yet or anything. I was thinking of maybe like a cat tent or something. When should I get a harness for them? Collars too? I just don't want them to outgrow the stuff right away. How should I approach trying to walk them?

You can't teach your cat all the *nuances* of being a cat. Yes, we can yelp when they bite us. Yes, we can smack them back (this is abuse and doesnt work ever). 

But we can't teach cats how to cat appropriately.

 We cant teach them to run, play and smack them when they gnaw on our ears too hard. We just aren't playmates appropriately for them. Please get them friends to rough house with!

They won't grow up playing eating you in little nibbled because you decided to play with them as tiny babies with your hands. Thus teaching them hands are toys.

They won't chase you through the house because *you* taught them this was acceptable when their fangs were a mere inch long. Those fangs turn into daggers. Please.

I adopted him from a local rescue, but they're not sure what his background is, only that his previous owner was pregnant and surrendered him. He was taken in by a foster for a couple weeks and she said that Apollo got along pretty well with the other foster kittens she had and that he liked to annoy the older cats.

Apollo has a TON of energy and loves to play. I've gotten a bunch of toys with him and have quickly learned that wand toys (like Da Bird) are the best to wear him out. I play with him and have him running and jumping around until he pants, 2-3 (or more) times per day. I do not and have never played with him using my hands or feet or any other body parts, only toys. The majority of the time, he's fine and is just being a regular ole kitten--exploring, being curious, napping for long periods of time, cuddling, etc. I have no reason to think that he's afraid of me or anything since he crawls into my lap at times and sleeps next to me on the bed. But 2-5 times per day, seemingly randomly, he'll pounce on my feet, legs, hands, or arms and grip on with his claws and bite me, most of the time drawing blood. He's done this after I play with him, right before he naps, right after he wakes up... I can't really pinpoint a consistent time pattern. I've tried redirecting his attacks to a toy or something else to bite/claw, hissing at him, clapping my hands or making other loud noises, tapping him on the head, removing him from me and putting him down, leaving the room or putting him in a different room, squirting him or near him with water, using a firm ""No"", and scruffing him (he sometimes still tries to swipe or bite me during this). Those have all stopped him for about a second, and then he comes right back and does the same thing. The only thing that seems to have somewhat worked is putting him in a different room for a few minutes to calm down, but he will sometimes attack again, just not right away.

We did a week of gradual desensitizing as recommended; e.g. feeding both of them with the door closed, short encounters with treats, scenting, etc. Since he was excited at the beginning, at times when the dog wanted to sniff him, he cornered my kitten inadvertently, causing the kitten to hiss and attempt to bat him in corners. I understand it was defensive behavior and our cockapoo was just being curious, but after two weeks of gradual introductions, the cockapoo has become quite afraid of the kitten when he comes close, or is passive while in the same room. We never left them unsupervised up until this point, and we did not see an actual injury on the dog from the kitten, but we had some close-calls. He will still attempt to sniff him at times and his tail still wags when he approaches him, but he walks away quickly, in caution.

During that time I will be living at my parents house. I will be living with 5 other girls in my new college house and I want the cat to know that I'm its owner and to love on me the most. Do you think it would be too much of a transition for the cat to be at my apartment, then my parents house, then my college house? Should I get him when I move to my parents house? Or just wait until I'm settled in my new house? I just want it to get attached to me and not one of my roommates, but I also don't want to over stimulate him. (p.s. he is a Maine Coon 4 months)",CatTraining,Thinking about getting my first cat please help!!

ConfusedSeagull,1595234520,huhugl,27,False,31,"Hello. I have an 8 year old cat, who, let's be fair, hasn't had the best youth(and I regret this, so please don't give me any). I found him on a vacation when I was 15 and he was 5 weeks, I was living alone and I didn't know much about cats. Anyways he turned out to be an absolute sweet heart. 
When he was about a year old, I took him to my mom's place, where another cat lives. They were doing great, but then the other cat got kittens and decided to hate him from that point. He befriended one of the kittens that my mom decided to keep.. until that kitten got run over by a car. 
Then he was alone again, and he was sad.
He kept fighting with the other cat, so we decided it would be best if I take him back to my place. (It's been around half a year) 

We tried to get another cat friend for him after a while, but they definitely did not hit it off. 

Fast forward to today. He's been an alone cat since, and is now 8. 
So a couple weeks back we found 4 kittens who was abandoned by their mom. We went to bring them inside to raise them until they can get new homes (this is what the shelter told us to do because there are no room for them there and they would just be put down because of their age)

He has been thrilled about the kittens. He runs around and plays with them, he brings them food and washes them, he just seems so happy. So we thought to keep the one he likes best, then he will have a friend. 

That's where the problems started. 

First problem,
Yesterday he scratched me, for the very first time in his life, which is a very big chok to me, Hence this post.
He loves them, but if I get too close he will hate them AND me. Whenever I touch them/him he will hiss at them or punch them. 
The same if they come to sit in my lap. Luckily no nails or teeth, just a bonk in the head and then he leaves.
Yesterday I picked him up near one of the kittens, and this is when he scratched me. If any of these things happen, he will spend most of the day trying to get away from us. Not hide, just get away. So we usually puts him in our bedroom where he will chill off for a couple of hours and then it's like if we reset him. It just works so well, like he forgot he just punched this kitten he's now washing.
Is this jealousy? And if it is, what can I do? I want him to have a good relationship with the kittens, but it just seems like he can't when I'm there too. 

Second problem,
In the night time we usually close the door to our bedroom, and he sleeps in his own room (an actual cat room we made for him)
This has never been a problem, but now it is.
Whenever we go to bed he will scream on the other side of the door. If we let him in he will just walk around our room and scream. In the morning he screams early and scratches the door. 
He has never done this, why is he starting now? Is it because he's really not as happy about the kittens as he seems? 
We tried everything we could think of. 
We ignored him for weeks but it doesn't change anything. 
We tried to put him in a smaller room.
We tried to put him in the kittens room so he's not alone.
We always play and feed before bed so this we didn't have to ""try"" 
Nothing works.

I have taken a lot of online courses and talked to a lot of vets since I found him as a kitten, but none explains this behavior.
We already got him checked, and even got his tummy scanned just in case, but everything is fine. The vet recommended me to find a cat behaviourist, but those are really exspensive, so I'm starting here on reddit. What is going on with my cat? I'm afraid he is digging his own grave if I cannot get him to stop, as the neighbors are starting to get annoyed, and rehoming is not an option and I don't want to put him in a shelter because I know he will never be adopted and eventually be put down anyways.

There is a lot more to this story, but I can't get it all down here.

 Please help me. He's everything to me.

Edit: some facts I forgot.
We found the kittens at about 3 weeks, so they grew up with him.
He is neutered but he still thinks he's a bull, probably because he was neutered too late. 
He has never had any behaviour issues before.
He has a very strong bond with me, hence we thought of jealousy, and rehoming as not an option.",CatTraining,"Help, my cat is digging his own grave"

Since the spring, my gf and I have been taking my cat Charlie outside to sit in the yard with us. We're only out there for 15 to 30 minutes and he's never outside unsupervised.

Well now he cries to go outside. Softly in the beginning but the last few months he'll yell at us and paw at the doorknob. He'll come find us to yell and cry and if we deny him, he will go to our basement (where the litterbox is) and poop on the floor.

jelvi,1595010009,ht0vk0,2,False,1,"*\*\*Repost from my other account, with updated video for those who were asking!\*\**

It only took 3 nights of training my cat to get it down; I am beyond excited, I couldn't even train my dog to roll over. As a 1yr old kitty, she's up to 5 tricks now.

*Note : I trained her so ""down"" is like ""play dead"" or ""lay down""; when she does ""sit"", sometime it's just her in the crouched/'cat loaf' position vs actual sitting, but that doesn't matter much to me right now.* 

**How I did it:**

sit --&gt; down --&gt; roll over

When the cat is laying on her side, guide the treat so the cat flips onto their back before completing the roll. Usually this is preceded with a confused head tilt motion when laying down. Repeat the phrase ""Roll over"" with a distinct intonation while guiding them from side laying down -&gt; to on their back (tummy up) -&gt; and completed roll. 

I often used my hands to help flip her over, which she didn't like too much, but she got the hint eventually. After the first few times I guided her with my hands (while repeating the phrase), I stopped and continued the training by having her lay down and with me repeating the phrase while looking at her. This is usually where the confused head tilt motion comes in. It may take awhile but eventually she will flip on her back and I will guide to finish the motion. If she gets out of the laying position, I just guide her back down to it (unless she is very sassy and resistant). Eventually the cat will pick up that rollover = flip to other side = treat. 

Stop when cat is too distracted, once you try for 5 complete rolls, or once it's been 10 minutes of training.

# Summary:

* **your cat should at least know sit &amp; down first**
   * this makes it easier to practice rollover, but also is easier for them to pick up on later tricks since they understand that certain word = treat.
* **use a distinct intonation for your trick phrase** 
   * in the video, you can kind of hear that ""sit"" has a high inflexion, ""down"" has a low inflexion, and ""rollover"" has a certain pattern to the sound. This helps the cat understand the words better and gives the tricks some consistency for them to pick up on it easier.
* **Learning comes in phases**
   * after putting her in starting position ""lay down"", manually guide your cat with your hands  while repeating the phrase
   * having your cat in starting position and repeat the phrase while looking at your cat 
      * this can take awhile / be awkward but they will know that they need to do something for the treat since you still haven't given it to them. 
      * You may still need to guide them a bit. Expect confusion from your cat.
* **always reward with a treat**
   * Always give a treat once the roll has been completed, no matter how long it took or if it was just you manually maneuvering your cat with your hands the whole time

Often after learning a new trick, cat's might start doing it all the time. Which is great, except when you say ""sit"" and they rollover, it isn't great. Make sure to correct your cat and keep practicing the other tricks so they don't only know the most recent trick.

my 3 mo kitten is having problems going outside of the litter box. i consulted this page a week or two ago &amp; decided to use an enzymatic cleaner to deter her from returning to the spots. at first, the cleaner seemed to be working great. she wouldn‚Äôt even visit the areas i had sprayed it in. a few days later, though, and she was trying to pee on the floor in the same spots again. i don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs doing this because i regularly clean the box and see pee clumps, so i know she is sometimes using the box. my new theory is that she wants a separate box to pee in, but again i know she‚Äôs gone in the box so i‚Äôm not sure why she would want a separate space only sometimes. i have a friend coming in town this weekend &amp; she‚Äôs bringing her babies &amp; extra boxes, so maybe idgie will use one of those &amp; i will know she needs an extra.

Jynx spends most of her time downstairs. 1 litter box is where she pees the most (a little spot beside the fireplace that is meant to store firewood, the bottom made of concrete). 

We have tried spraying 'cat deterent' is places we don't want her to pee, adding litter attractant to the litter, trying various litters, changing the litter box style, changing places of the litter box, trying to retrain her to use the litter box, putting food/water in different places to see if that makes a difference, using Feliway, and nothing has worked. 

The cats hang out together sometimes, but Jynx gets upset when one cat Buddy likes to play with her too much. He is younger so still like a kitten. She'll get mad at him, swat/hiss, runaway. But not all the time. I can't think of anything else significant.",CatTraining,"Inappropriate peeing, really need a solution"

I  have two cats, small 6 year old sisters (Alicia and Mrs Robinson).  Until recently neither had ever clawed anyone in anger at least in the  house. I have had a housemate living living with me for about a year and  he has his own cat and a now 8 year old daughter who visits at weekends  and during lockdown has been staying here for a while. Alicia is the  dominant cat of the house and is normally aggressively affectionate with  people often including new visitors to the house. She will jump in  peoples laps, headbutt and kneed them demanding fuss. Mrs Robinson is  much more nervous of newcomers but once she gets comfortable with some  she also loves to be fussed. My housemates cat is a rescue, very nervous  but has established a few small patch's of territory in the house and  seems to have settled in. Alicia still hates her but just tolerates her.

All  three cats in the house have been stressed recently because the big bad  tom of the area has left the scene and my neighbors have two new cats,  one a tom larger than my cats. There have been a lot of territory fights  and new cats in my garden. To the point my cats have been asking to be  let out the front door and preferring to not use the cat flap from the  back door into the enclosed porch. The rescue cat moved out and lived  under a nearby shed for a week. We have had new cats coming into the  house and the microchip cat flap has had to be turned on.

My  housemates daughter love animals, has a dog and some other pets at home  and has wanted to be friends with my cats from when she first visited.  Alicia has until recently always avoided interaction which was unusual  but I put it down to the smell of dog. Mrs Robinson avoided her for  about 8 months but now is affectionate and even goes and sleeps in bed  with her some nights. She is one of the few people who can always  approach and fuss my housemates cat.  A couple of months ago Alicia  started letting the girl interact with her and we encouraged it with  some treats. At some point Alicia swiped her when I wasn't present not a  nasty scratch but a lot of tears mostly from hurt feelings. A few days  later she was fussing Alicia in the living room, I saw her following  Alicia when Alicia walked away from her and I could see the cat body  language danger signs and was about to warn her to leave the cat alone  but was too late and a single 1"" scratch again. Floods of tears for a  fair while. Her dad and I told her to leave Alicia alone for now and  focus on the fact the other two cats both loved her. She kept to this  for a while and didn't approach Alicia.

About  a month ago Alicia started approaching the girl for fuss and she was  really pleased. She even started going into the girls room. Then one  evening when having approached the child and being fussed for a while  she seemingly randomly swiped her again leaving just a tiny nick on her  elbow. The child was upset but bounced back quickly.

I'm  not sure how to handle this now. The child really wants to be friends  with all the cats but she will keep her distance if told to do so but  Alicia is now being the one to initiate interactions. I'm really bemused  by Alicia's behavior as she is normally very placid and trusting with  humans. She's never hurt anyone else that I know of and will let people  pick her up off chairs and put her down on one of the cat areas without  even uncurling or opening her eyes. She is to be fair a little shit with  other cats. I don't know what we should tell the child since Alicia  seems to be slowly warming to her but we don't want her to get hurt  again. Any ideas?

Summing up.  Alicia an alpha who always has fought for her status in the household  with other cats (I've had a few housemates) but things have always  settled down after a few months. She is great with humans but this is  the first child that has been in the house with her. The child will reek  of dog and my housemates cat, of whom she is not a fan.

I have to lure the mom into the garden as is her routine, and then with a blanket or towels try to put her into the carrier. Then take her to the vet. This way she can hopefully forget about her kittens after the operation is over. I worry about her between the time she is in the carrier and the actual operation, which could be several hours.

He will eventually use it if left to it but the stress indicators are very apparent and I don't like causing him undue stress.

Now he will meow, loudly and incessantly, until one of us comes out, tells him he's the goodest boy, at which point he'll go investigate both litterboxes before asking final permission to use whichever one he selected.

Tl;dr: Got new puppy, cat is hanging out near the dog, which causes the dog to want to play, and then the cat swats her instead of staying out of reach.

  
Context: Mercutio is a 7yr old neutered male, grey shorthair, VERY attached to me but not fond of other people. He has not had great socialization - I got him from the humane society as a baby and he was a loner (no litter, no mum) and I think he probably left his mum too early. When we have people over he will often approach them but then swat or bite if they try to pet him (although this has gotten better over the last year). During a normal day, he mostly just lounges around the house, likes to watch birds out the window, and comes for cuddles/playtime when he wants it.

  
Changes: We moved from our old small apt to a large house in October 2019 - he loved it. So much more room to run around, and furniture to climb on, plus he has 2 litterboxes so he can be picky about where he goes. He's been way more active and lost a bunch of weight (he was previously a tubby 15lbs, now a nice svelte 11lbs), especially cause we've found some jingly mouse toys that he loves to play fetch with.  


Problem: In mid-June, we got a puppy, Toby. She's a Bernese/Groenendael cross and was 8wks old, now 11wks. The puppy is socialized to cats - she lived with several, some of which were friendly and others which were not, but she tries to play with Mercutio if he comes in the room. We've been working on training her to leave him alone, but she's a baby so it's not always effective. We keep Toby blocked into one room at a time with baby gates, but Merc can vault them easily to leave the room. However, he'll come into the room, hang out on the floor and wait for Toby to come up - then he swats at her. Or he'll jump onto a couch right above her and wait til she looks up, then swat at her. He doesn't hiss, and he only runs away if she starts barking.

I don't understand this behaviour - it seems like he doesn't want to play with the puppy, but he keeps putting himself in her ""playtime"" zone, when he could easily just leave or stay up on the back on the couches (which is where he hangs out normally anyway). Even when I take him out of the room, he comes right back.  He's had some stress-related health issues in the past, so I'm super careful to make sure he still gets lots of attention when Toby's napping and there's been no signs of stress in terms of eating/bathroom.

After a month of trying to integrate him after rescue and doing so with other cat, cat is still aggressively playing and launched himself at me today and cut me up. Still chasing other solitary cat around the house. Help so we can keep him?

More detail: 
So my mother-in-law was given a beautiful black cat from her old boss. He's a big cat with only ten white hairs on his chest. He was left in guy's apartment by an angry tenant without food or water. He survived off of cheese crackers, poor boy. So the boss tried to keep him and tried to find a home for him, but due to allergies and him being a black cat, which I just learned how they're treated, he was unsuccessful. He lucked out by reconnecting my mother in law who then gave him to us (out of a lack of air conditioning in her car and her being too far in 90 degree weather). We have had him since then trying to make it work. Our other boy cat, Reno, was in palliative care due to a rare cancer at 4. For us, it wasn't a great time--but this poor black cat had been abandoned and we wanted to make it work. 

Cat, we named him Winston, was a total sweetheart. He would hug me, never bit me despite me handling him so early (he tried to jump out of the car after getting out of the carrier), and would rest on my hand. Then, we tried to introduce him to our other cat, Sylvie, Reno's sister after a week after Reno's passing. We had them separated for a week before that. Winston chases Sylvie around and she hisses whenever he comes near.  He's twice her size as she is a small silver shorthair. 

I'm unsure if it is trauma or just his rough play, but she wants nothing to do with him. It has now been four weeks and nothing has changed.

I was playing with him for a bit and he went and tried to play bite my leg, which I didn't want to engage. So I put on one of those chasing toys for him and left. He came back to my spot across the house looking for me. I tried to engage him in a toy because I could tell he was frustrated. And then he launched himself at me and just started biting and scratching. My husband had to get a spray bottle to get him off of me. 

Poor cat has been so traumatized but I want to get some expert opinions on how I can help him and get him to stay. All I know is that the abandon-er didn't have him for long and just left him there. He's only five. We know nothing about his history except that after we took him to the vet we learned he's healthy and was just underweight from his ordeal. But no knowledge of history or anything. Only that he seems to gravitate towards men. 

Any thoughts on how to help this poor guy? I would really love to be able to keep him but I don't know how to help him stay, get along with my other cat, and not suddenly launch at me and scratch me up.

Gyatso-san,1593535048,hiqu6b,6,False,1,"Hello there.

Me and my partner adopted 3 cats over the course of our relationship. Two males, one is 7 years old, the other 4 and one female, 5 years old. Gustav (oldest male) is very passive and peaceful, Tubbs (youngest male) is very fearful and possessive. Our lady is extremely sassy and independent.
They've been fully indoors for most of their lives. They've also been separated for a while before we moved countries. We have relocated a few times, both in our home country and in our current country, and have lived in the same place for more than a year.
Tubbs generally tries to own everything in the house. Boxes, tunnels, toys, attention, cushions, the lady, you name it.. He wants it all. What happens is, when Tubbs sees Gustav in a tunnel, he sometimes goes on and tries to claim it for himself. Gustav gest scared and sometimes tries to fight back. When this happens, Tubbs becomes very aggressive, screaming, hissing and chasing Gustav all over, seeking a fight. Gustav becomes submissive and just runs away somewhere Tubbs can't reach. This behaviour is displayed specially when we intervene. Sometimes they seem all relaxed, but the moment we give Tubbs a bit more attention through petting him, he will instantly go after Gustav, who was minding his own business in the corner.
In our bedroom, Gustav spends most of his time on top of our wardrobe, where Tubbs can't reach him. But we still see Tubbs looking at him and really wanting to climb there to probably expell Gustav and claim the space for himself.
This is very confusing for us and we really don't know what to do. Tubbs seems very possessive towards everything.

We usually look out for the signs that mean our kitten is overstimulated and avoid petting him. When he gets too excited and bites or scratches, we say no, leave and avoid him.

There are situations that warrant handling our kitten when he doesn't want to be handled, like giving him his worming tablets, a bath and cleaning his bum after a messy poo. In these circumstances, we usually only handle him as long as necessary and then let him go, and during this process, he will try to wiggle free and sometimes bite. The ultimate result is obviously being set free so he must have associated biting to being let go.

Now, when we pick him up to e.g. wipe his face clean or even stick out our arm to stop him from walking to a shelf, he'll bite us. It doesn't break skin but it's not soft either. We shout no firmly and ignore him, but it feels like it's getting worse over time.

Her cat is extremely sweet and we love him but he has some strange behaviors. 

He has extreme energy I've never seen in another cat. He will fetch and launch himself off of couches, run vertically on the sides of them and will run around till he is basically panting but still doesnt like to stop. He also has a major hunting drive that controls most of his play. He needs to be tired out multiple times a day, especially before bed. If he doesn't get excercise before bed hes more likely to wake us up. Sometimes in the morning he jumps on my girlfriend's sternum like a fox hunting. Hes also woken me by ripping out my hair.

He's very aggressive towards other cats. Once he got out of the house to fight a stray cat outside and then ran back in. When ever he's seen another cat he's wanted to fight and gets puffed up.

Hes been licking my girlfriend's hand excessively for the past couple of days and tonight he was trying to hump it, hence me ending up writing this post. He woke up in the middle of the night to do this. He sniffed and latched onto her arm, following it where ever it went. It was kind of creepy.

His favorite is smacking at the door knob which creates a God awful racket, waking up either my fiance or me, or both.

I've tried double sided sticky tape, barely makes a difference. We now have a new mattress with a platform base, and now he'll scratch all over. So short of wrapping the entire mattress, this isn't even a valid solution.

And after it ran out of air, he'd be back to attacking the door.

We have a box for a large TV, which fit perfectly into our door frame. Then he'd jump on top to scratch or play with a hook thing on our door (we're renting, it was there when we got the place &amp; is firmly in place so we cant get it out). Or he'd manage to move the box &amp; get around it.

We've litterally tried barricading our door/part of the hallway to keep him out. Every single time, he finds a way around it.

There was one incident in the past when the cat was having a territory dispute with a stray through the screen at a front window.

However, last week the cat attacked my mom seemingly unprovoked. She was sitting in a chair reading a magazine with her legs outstretched and the cat suddenly leapt onto her leg and gave her several bites and scratches. When she yelled and tried to shoo him away, he reacted by posturing, staring her down, and waving his tail aggressively, as if preparing to make another attack. She managed to leave the room without being grabbed again but she was definitely shaken.

The only red flag he has is that he‚Äôs territorial and marks the windows and walls despite having been neutered at 12wks. He is about 7 or 8 years old now. It‚Äôs gotten better but old habits die hard.

There was one incident in the past when the cat was having a territory dispute with a stray through the screen at a front window. My mom decided to shut the window to end the fight but startled the cat and got some very bad bites to her hand. This was several years ago and there has been nothing similar since. 

However, last week the cat attacked my mom seemingly unprovoked. She was sitting in a chair reading a magazine with her legs outstretched and the cat suddenly leapt onto her leg and gave her several bites and scratches. When she yelled and tried to shoo him away, he reacted by posturing, staring her down, and waving his tail aggressively, as if preparing to make another attack. She managed to leave the room without being grabbed again but she was definitely shaken. 

I asked if she was wiggling her legs or feet and she said no. They were simply outstretched in front of the chair. She wasn‚Äôt making eye contact with him because she was reading. Then I asked if it seemed like he was playing and she said definitely not.

In the past when the cat was little we used to play fight with him by holding out hands or feet and he‚Äôd tackle us, but it was always in play and he never took the game seriously. 

What could cause a cat to suddenly become aggressive like that with no provocation? Is there a way to prevent this if we don‚Äôt know what caused it? 

My mom has said that if the cat bites her one more time it will be three strikes and she wants the cat gone. 

I want to help her but this has baffled me. 
I‚Äôve never seen a cat act like that before.

The only thing my mom could think of was that her dog died recently of old age. The cat and dog weren‚Äôt close, but they weren‚Äôt enemies either. They mostly ignored each other. But the cat would leave if the dog walked up. My mom thinks that maybe because the dog is gone the cat assumes himself to be in charge of the household now? That the dog was a buffer somehow?

Now the problem is Link is very needy and constantly meows (I mean *constant* meowing, if he is awake there is an 80% chance he is making noise). It's partly what I love about him, he's snuggly and follows me around like a shadow and we have some very good conversations. But sometimes it drives me absolutely insane, like from 4-5am every single night. 

My partner and I sleep with the door closed because otherwise Link will just walk all over our faces, nip our toes and meow as soon as the petting stops. Sleeping with the door closed has been better, I feed him right before bed (11pm ish) and he is actually pretty quiet until 4am. But then comes the screaming outside our bedroom. I've learned to ignore it and we try white noise machines, or a fan to drown out the yowling but recently the cat has figured out how to open the door. He jumps up and grabs the L shaped door knob, and it takes many attempts but he will eventually let himself in and again meow on our faces. I don't mind the snuggles as much but my partner is slightly allergic to cats; it's normally manageable, but he gets red itchy eyes and a stuffy nose when the cat is literally on his face. The whole opening the door thing is driving me insane too, he makes a racket when he jumps up to grab the door knob and I absolutely hate being woken up every morning to a loud crashing sound.

susurintree,1592372601,hal5a8,8,False,1,"My boyfriend (29M) and I (29F) adopted Cora (11 month old torbie) from a rescue in May this year. The rescue explained that Cora would require some patience and continued training because she was part of a feral cat colony for her first 3.5 months of life. She was terrified of both of us for the first couple weeks, but she‚Äôs since gotten very comfortable in her new home. She scares easily and still resists being carried, but she loves getting pet and will even sleep on our laps when we sit on the couch. Cuddling has become a much cherished nightly ritual. 

Buuuuut.... for the past week she‚Äôs started to develop a habit of ‚Äúplayfully‚Äù attacking my boyfriend. I use scare quotes because the attacks range from genuinely playful little claw-free cat punches to moderately serious claws out swipes/pounces. It used to only be a nighttime thing but now it‚Äôs expanded to all hours of the day. For example, he‚Äôll be sitting at his desk in his swivel chair fiddling with his laptop, and she‚Äôll slink up to his chair to bat at his back maybe once or twice before returning to a seated position to stare him straight in the eyes after he yells in alarm. Or she‚Äôll have been sleeping peacefully on his lap for 15-20 minutes when she‚Äôll suddenly wake up and decide to go for his foot under the blanket. 

At first we thought the foot in blanket thing was just her confusing the movement of his feet for a mouse or something. But it keeps happening. Even when he doesn‚Äôt have a blanket covering his feet, she‚Äôll start going for them, playfully at first, but then escalating in level of force &amp; with claws or nips unless one of us redirects her attention to a cat teaser or some other activity. None of her scratching and biting has led to any serious wounds, and it‚Äôs pretty clear that she isn‚Äôt seriously trying to hurt him.

She never really does this with me, even when I sit in the same seat where my boyfriend gets attacked most frequently, or when I‚Äôm sitting with her on the couch. She seems to single him out for this treatment. The general rule seems to be that she‚Äôll keep going after him with escalating force until someone plays with her, most often me. Yelling no when she hurts him hasn‚Äôt really deterred her from trying again.

My boyfriend has never had a cat before or interacted with many cats even in passing. He was already very afraid of interacting with her even before this phase, and he‚Äôs getting very frustrated. He‚Äôll get anxious when she approaches him bc he‚Äôs not sure if she‚Äôs coming in for a gentle head butt or to try to pounce on him like he‚Äôs one of her (many) toys. 

I‚Äôve speculated that it‚Äôs his reluctance to interact with her that makes her seek him out even more, but I don‚Äôt really know how to get her to request his attention in a less aggressive manner. 

I already play with her for (no joke) at least several hours a day (working from home during shelter in place has allowed for a lot of quality cat time...). We also have one of those hot pursuit thingies for her to try to kill when we don‚Äôt have time to whip around the teaser.

I‚Äôm not sure what more we could or should be doing? My boyfriend already plays with her on his own for about an average of like 20-30 minutes throughout a day. He feels as if we‚Äôve been spoiling her and giving her too much attention. He wants to reduce the amount of playtime that she gets from both of us. I tend to think this will probably make her act out even more. 

Any advice for how to get her to stop attacking him would be greatly appreciated.

inteligega,1592351269,hafpqv,8,False,1,"So it's a long story.  
My friend has a cat named Yoko. She is castrated, very sweet and needy. She always follows you, very touchy.  
She's used to stay in my home because my friend often travels.  
I have a male cat named Kuro they get along well. Always playing and stuff.

  
Last time, she was here about two months already, behaving normally. When, one night, suddenly I hear a very strange ""meow"" from her late into the night. I wake up and call them both near their plates of food to see what's going on. Both came from different places and suddenly she starts to attack my cat. I separated them and after a while I thought they were more calm and ""ok"" and decided to let them meet. It happened again. I had to put my cat in a separate room. I tried to make a slow contact between them, by opening a small space of the door. Firstly she seemed ok, trying to touch him with her paw, but then again. She suddenly started screaming really angry and I closed the door. She kept screaming to me and as I retrieved she advanced always looking ready to attack me. I called for help and as my mother and brother showed up, she stopped. But still, she was roaring angrily, and if you moved  she would scream-meowing angrily. Sometimes she would let me stay near and touch her. Very strange...

I called my friend to come and see if he could help. He came and took her. She didn't showed the same behavior towards him and while with him, in his place, she was normal. For weeks.

  
Some weeks after, my friend had to move out so he needed a place for Yoko to stay for a while. She stayed with me, but this time in my girlfriend's place. She was normal. Very needy, touchy. After almost two weeks. I had to go home and decided to take her with me. Coming home, I noticed that she was quiet and distant. I saw that she wasn't enjoying my cat trying to play with her and even hissed at him sometimes, but that was normal between them every other time. Some hours later while we were all in the same room, she out of nowhere meows angrily and start running to attack my cat. I successfully push her to the bathroom and close the door because I was very close.  
This day I isolated both. After some hours and some normal meows I decided to open the bathroom door to see if she was more calm. She was not. She started to roar angrily. I closed the door again. Again, after some hours and some normal meows, I decided to open again a let my bedroom door open to her come and have access to her sandbox, food and water.

  
She came and while walking near me she started hissing, meowing angrily so I decided to close her on my room. Having a lot of trouble to do so, I took her to my girlfriend' place again because I thought the problem was my cat. Arriving there, she seemed like a completely different cat. She was looking like her usual. Started rubbing her cheeks on things and on me, used her sandbox. I did some petting on her, but at one point, after a few pettings, I saw that she was quite strange and in the last petting she showed her teeths then I backed off and she started meow-screaming again like crazy. She went under the sofa and looked really mad, I went to another place and locked her on the living room. Now she was screaming like crazy. Looked scared and just by coming near the door she started screaming and angry roar.

Again, I called my friend. After taking a lot of courage I slowly crossed the living room to be able to open the door to him. With him, she didn't behave angrily. He took her, and left her one day at the veterinary clinic, and the next day he traveled to his new home in other city with her.

For one week and so, she was normal. But then, yesterday my friend washed his bed sheet. He was laying on his bed with her and he decided to take off one of the two blankets he was using because it was too hot. She started to behave defensive aggressive again. And is like that until now. He isolated her in one other room. When the door is closed she meows for attention, but when he opens it, she becames scared defensive and starts to meow-scream and angry roar.

We looke for some specialist in cat behavior but we can't find anyone nearby or even on the internet.

Can someone help? It's very scary. We are sad, and my friend is even thinking abouting giving her away to someone. (He has babies, although right now he is not living with them).

LostTerminal,1592006222,h7w8u3,9,False,9,"Hello feline enthusiasts! I am posting here just to see what someone outside of my house thinks about this. Sorry it is a little lengthy.

About 9 months ago, I rescued a 3-6 year old spayed Turkish Angora with heterochromea and zero deafness. She was used as a breeder for several years and has had multiple litters.

She has adapted fairly well here over 9 months, enjoys the 2 older kids but is deathly fearful of my 3 year old. One behavior, however, has driven us up the wall and is only getting worse.

The __*meowing*__.

Look, I know that this particular breed is one of the most vocal pet cat breeds that exist. I looked it up. Thing is, though... they are listed *under* Siamese in that regard. I have been around a number of Siamese cats, and every single one them has been like a silent monk compared to this Mama (that's her name). She is constantly meowing, trilling, or yowling. If she's quiet, she's asleep. This would not honestly be a problem... except for her yowling at night and in the mornings.

At night and after play, I lay down in my bed. Mama hops in bed, lays next to me until I start drifting off to sleep and my hand stops petting. This is when she hops out of bed and runs to her dry food bowl where she loudly (purposefully louder than during the day) crunches through whatever food is left in it since meal time. This could be a lot, it could be a little. Either way, she eats it with the relative discretion of an electric pencil sharpener. As SOON as she finishes the last crumb, she saunters to the side of the bed and __*yowls*__ like she is in pain or heat right next to my head. If I move at all like I am sitting up, she flurries (as fellow cat owners, you know what I mean) out of the room as if I was a demon on fire wielding a spray bottle. I don't see her until morning.

Oh, and by ""morning"" I mean an ungodly hour I am not accustomed to in the slightest. Between 5 and 7am (whenever she feels like) she decides it is time to wake up. She goes on another yowling spree. This is 100% always ignored, and I remain in bed like a stone. After a few minutes, she stops, and I fall back asleep. Here is the worst part, though. She knows the difference between asleep and ""asleep."" It's something she hears, I guess? If I am waking up at my own time, she begins to yowl all over again. And this happens immediately. Like the worst alarm clock that only goes off 10 seconds after you wake up, there's no ""off"" or ""snooze"" and throwing something at it gets you bad looks from everyone.

So here's my conclusion. I have been tolerating this behavior for 9 months. We ignore her pleas as much as humanly possible, but she won't stop occupying our air waves with the song of her people. I have scoured the net looking for tips that include ignoring her, training her to be quiet by only giving her attention when she is quiet (literally impossible, as she meows as soon as you attempt to engage her), and making sure she is good and effing tired by bed time.

Nothing is working, and in fact, she is only getting louder and more frequent with her nightly, morning, and daily yowling. She has no health issues (she went to the vet before we got her, and again about a month and a half ago), and this is purely behaviorial. So did I adopt the most stubborn, loud, and annoying cat ever? Or is there hope in getting her to quiet down a little?",CatTraining,"Turkish Angora, do they ever shut up?"
TimeYam,1591949315,h7gneg,18,False,17,"Ok so here goes. I have 2 cats. They will be named fat cat and skinny cat from here on out.

Fat cat and skinny cat have been free fed dry kibble their whole lives and are adults. I'm trying to switch them to wet food meals right now to better monitor their caloric intake, but I cannot for the life of me get them to eat meals. They like the wet food, but they are both grazers and will leave their bowls after a few bites, and although I try, i just can't monitor them 24/7 to make sure they are eating their own share!

I have tried separating them into different rooms, but they hate being secluded and just don't eat when I do that. Skinny cat is also a more aggressive eater especially with wet food, and he steals fat cat's food so I am worried she may not be getting enough calories, which I guess is better than the other way around since she needs to lose weight, but I worry about her getting liver problems! Fat cat will eat the wet food but definitely prefers dry. I have tried different elevations, putting skinny cat's food on the fridge, but although he can easily reach it, he prefers to just steal from fat cat's bowl on the ground??? And then fat cat just lets him and doesn't eat because she is fairly submissive. I am honestly confused as to how she got so fat in the first place!

Anyway I am about ready to just give up and go back to free feeding because monitoring them constantly is so exhausting! But I really worry about fat cat and her health so I want to at least try my best. Any advice?",CatTraining,Help! How do I get my fat cat on a diet in a multi pet household???

Krovav,1591749129,h0040c,4,False,11,"Trying to condense relevant info as best as possible but long post. I'm also on mobile and can't find the full sub info; apologies if anything is redundant in regards to that:

- His name is Velemir, he will be 10 years old in July. He was a stray for most of his life, is neutered but the shelter wasn't sure when, and is FIV positive. He is a healthy weight with no arthritis/bad teeth/injuries/etc, just a flea allergy.

- We adopted him in late February 2020 from a highly recommended shelter. He had been briefly fostered with no reported issues other than he was a bit grumpy and didn't like to be held for too long. I had no problem with this and expected, given his age and personality, that he would mostly just sleep and eat like my previous senior ex-stray cats.

- He originally played, albeit lazily. He was also warming up to cuddling and would lay on my lap every so often. This changed two months in. 

And so begins the issues:

- After two months he decided to explore the rest of the house and got extremely territorial over my roommate's rooms. He also got fleas when his flea meds lapsed for a month and had a massive scabby flea allergy reaction. He's still having some remnants of a flea allergy and somehow got ear mites which I'm treating and is slowly getting better. The vet says his FIV is making the skin recovery slow but ultimately he's fine.

I opted to scale back his territory to introduce him more slowly and got him on flea meds. But after that point, he now refuses to play no matter how many different toys I try, won't cuddle, won't even use his cat tower anymore. The only thing he expends energy on positively is scratchers. The rest of his energy he uses on over-grooming, door-dashing, hiding, pretty much every behavior Jackson Galaxy has taught me is a sign of stress. I think it's also worth mentioning that when Velemir hides, he is completely comfortable and seems to just be chilling out.


Things I've Tried:
- walking, multiple attempts (afterward he sits at the door and caterwauls nonstop for hours because he wants to go back outside)
- cat towers (won't touch them anymore)
- catnip (loves it but just lays on catnip toys, won't play with them, also becomes aggresive and overgrooms)
- various wands
- mice toys
- lasers
- ground chasers
- cat TVs (he likes the birds but doesn't care enough to wait for them)
- socializing (but he's aggressive with other cats and dislikes dogs)
- various feeding schedules
- clicker training (he dosen't respond to a clicker no matter how much I charge it up)
- food motivation (picky eater who dosen't seem to care that much for food even if he likes it)


The one thing he doesn't misbehave on is that he always uses his litter box perfectly.

How do I get this cat to expend his energy? I'm at the point where I don't want to rehome him but I also won't put an animal through this obvious level of stress he seems to be in 24/7 and I'm running out of ideas to help him.",CatTraining,"Help, Recent Senior Adopt Won't Play?"

supermonkey_,1591723337,gzrknh,3,False,3,"I brought my 2 y/o female recently adopted domestic shorthair to the vet the other day and he suggested that she may be experiencing anxiety.  we adopted her in April. The vets suggestion was to get a feliway diffuser, and if that doesn‚Äôt help, come back and consider medication.

i have a feliway diffuser but I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference in her behavior since getting it. I suspect the dog may be a part of her anxiety; when we first adopted her she would hiss at my dog often, but hasn‚Äôt hissed in a while and seems to just avoid/ignore her. I‚Äôm moving soon, so the dog will be out of the picture in a month or so.

Here are the symptoms I‚Äôve noticed:
1. Aggression. She bites my arms and ankles pretty often and pretty hard. Sometimes when I pet her, but sometimes she will just come upstairs into my room and start gnawing unprompted. She really only does this to me, not the 2 other adults in my house.  She also bats things like crazy; I think she has slapped every fabric item in my house. She seems genuinely afraid of the objects...she will kind of duck around them and if I touch the item she will jump back.

2. Yowling. She meows pretty loud any time I‚Äôm not in the same room as her.  She follows me around most of the time. She sits outside the bathroom door while I use the bathroom / shower. She sleeps at the foot of my bed. She only does this to me.

3. Not using her litter box. Maybe once every week? 2 weeks? She will piddle outside her box. The weird part is she will pee really close to it? Her litter box is in the basement and she will pee within 2-3 feet of it. I empty her litter box 1-2 times a day, and I usually chalk that symptom up to the box being fuller than she‚Äôd like.

4. Grooming. She does groom quite a bit, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs beyond normal. I only mention this symptom because her foster parent said she groomed often, and the foster has other cats so I assume she has a good gauge for it.

Do these symptoms line up right? I‚Äôm a first time cat owner so I can‚Äôt always tell what is normal cat stuff. Does anyone have experience with this and can give me some guidance/personal experience/advice?  Is she perhaps just still getting used to my house?

I've tried playtime before dinner, adding treats to her dinner, adding catnip, playing with her throughout the day, spray bottle, grabbing her and trapping her in the blankets on the bed, moving her to the scratching post, ignoring her and everything. I tried having a down to the minute night schedule, like I would for school, but to no avail. 

now she's started playfully attacking the dog. the dog does not appreciate claws in her while she tries to sleep and so they got into a fight last night. (no blood, everyone is ok but it was loud af)

auroraggs,1591669868,gze2xq,3,False,3,"I‚Äôve been leash training my cat for many months now. I started with him wearing the harness indoors. Then I began putting the harness and leash on him and opening the door to my porch and letting him come onto the porch himself (instead of me picking him up and placing him there). He explored into the neighbors porches a few times but mostly he just sits there with me and never tries to go down the porch stairs onto the sidewalk. We have been doing that a few times a week for 2 months in the evenings (because he won‚Äôt come out in the day due to the street sounds).

Tonight I took him outside in his soft carrier to the dog park. No one uses the park at that time and I thought it might be a good place to start our outdoor adventures. My cat was curious and started exploring and eventually got near a wooded area. Suddenly he heard some sound and jumped in the air, then freaked out because the leash was preventing him from escaping in the woods, and then started jumping like crazy. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and was calling out to him trying to calm him down, and then I tried to get on top of him, but he managed to get out of the harness and ran into the woods. it was very dark at this time and i really thought I would lose him forever.

First off, there are some major litter box problems. BW cat uses the box every time, but B cat will usually poop in the box, and exclusively pee on the bed. I mean, within 24 hours, this happens probably 5-6 times. This has been going on consistently for the 3 weeks we have had them. We actually have to stay in the room and wait for B cat to squat on the bed, then move her to the box and she will pee in it. Sometimes she will jump out, run to the bed, and squat, and be moved to the box again several times before she gives in and uses the box.

We never punish her for accidents, and praise the crap out of her when she does use the box, but I'm not going to lie, I can't keep this up. We watch her like hawks and still don't catch it every time. We wash the entire bedding a minimum of once a day and have already hosed down the mattress several times. We use vinegar to clean and also spray lemon scent in the spots she likes to use, which she seems unaffected by.

B cat is currently on antibiotics for a potential UTI and showing no improvement, so I'm starting to doubt that it is due to painful urination or a medical problem.

Second, neither of the cats bury their poop or pee. This results in them stepping in it and tracking it everywhere on a daily basis. We have an XL litter box that is scooped daily, but the problem is still significant.

Additionally, neither of the cats clean themselves properly. So when they get dirty, they stay dirty. We have to wipe them down with wet wipes on a daily basis, which of course they hate. Again, we can't keep this up forever.

We can't just shut them out of the bedroom because we rent this room (not the house) and they must stay in there with us at night.

Almost two years ago, she started developing pain when she eats. We found out she has stomatitis, which basically causes inflamed gums. We almost lost her due to infrequent eating, but removing her back teeth improved her symptoms immensely and she's doing much better now. She seems healthy and mostly happy.

She developed unique eating habits from this. She will only eat at my boyfriend's desk and he has to be sitting with her, and she will only eat wet food. She still has pain when eating but not as often.

Drinking water didn't use to bother her, but lately water has been causing her pain. She won't drink water out of a bowl anymore because she associates that with pain. We didn't notice this was a problem until she started ""hunting"" for other sources of water, i.e. sitting in the bathtub, getting in the sink, drinking/tipping over water cups. 

When we noticed this, my boyfriend started mixing water into her wet food and this has worked. He measures out the appropriate amount of water for a kitty her size and she gets at least that much each day, if not more.

The problem is that, even though she seems to be getting plenty of water now, she's still seeking water quite obsessively. Every morning she goes on a hunt, pacing back and forth, looking for any and all sources of water. It's like that's all she does now and she seems distressed while she's searching. We tried increasing her water intake but no matter how much she gets, she still searches.

Do you think this is behavioral, or do you think this is related to a medical issue? If it's behavioral, any advice on helping her with this? She sees a vet on a regular basis due to her issues but he's been closed for a long time due to the virus.

Geoiv,1590790122,gt2end,3,False,1,"Hello r/CatTraining!

I've very recently adopted my new kitten, Simon, which has been absolutely life changing. Simon is a 12 week old Siberian, who is very confident, playful, and friendly. We've brought him into normal weight ranges from being underweight, gotten his clawing/scratching to a minimum, been working on his biting, and I've just begun clicker training with him - overall he is a well behaved little guy.

One thing I've loved about him from the first day he came home is that he loves to sit on my lap while I'm working at my desk - which is a daily happening during this pandemic. The issue is that the surface of my desk is only a few inches above my legs, a very manageable distance for him. At first, he would occasionally try to walk onto the desk from my lap, and I would simply set him back on my lap each time until he laid down, at which point I would be sure to give him lots of positive attention. As he's become more confident and comfortable in his new home, however, he is more more persistent. He'll try many more times, sometimes until I simply have no choice but to set him back on the ground for the sake of productivity, or until he gets frustrated and starts becoming a little bite-ey.

I wouldn't have an issue with him being on the desk if I could train him to only go on certain parts of it. Ideally, I'd have him just know not to go by the monitor or on the keyboard, but from what I can tell, that would be very difficult. So, a goal that I'm hoping is more realistic is to train him to know that it's fine to sit on my lap while I'm at the desk, but that is is not okay to walk from my lap onto the desk. I know there are plenty of articles on keeping a pet off of a surface, but this seems a little different; the surface is not a leap or a climb away, but just a few steps, and there are only so many deterrents I can set up on the desk that don't interfere with me working. At the end of the day I simply can't have him constantly trying to get on the desk while I'm working if he won't learn certain boundaries - but I don't want to sacrifice him growing into a lap cat. I should add, he has absolutely no interest in the desk if I'm not sitting at it, so keeping him off while I am not around is not as big of a concern.

I really expected to love having a cat in my home - but I did not anticipate developing such a driven dedication toward making sure that Simon gets the best out of everything he can in life. I truly view him as a full blown family member, not just a pet. As a result, I'm very open to any suggestions that anybody might have! Whether this can be integrated into clicker training, or if I have to do some totally different training, or just get creative with deterrents - I'm willing to hear it. I very much appreciate any words of wisdom from people who are likely much more experienced in this than I am! I hope to learn enough that, in time, I might be able to contribute back to the cat training community myself.",CatTraining,"Training that sitting on my lap while I'm at my desk is okay, but moving to the desk is not."

Phoebe, the cat in question, had a rocky kitten-hood. By the time I got her at 10 weeks old she already had 2 owners, and I was the third, which means she was inappropriately removed from her mother very early. She has also been very small throughout every age, which has lead me to speculate she might have also been the runt.

In the beginning it was just me, her, my mom, and our older family cat Tigger (12 yo at the time). Tigger is super chill and routinely brings home all kinds of cats (he is indoor/outdoor in a safe suburb) so he got along really well with phoebe.

I moved for grad school and took phoebe with me and she was just as sweet as ever, and was healthy in every regard- she ate well, played frequently, and chattered with me/slept with me every night.

Fast forward to fall of this last year and I moved permanently to NYC to be with my partner, and of course I brought phoebe. She adjusted well and was the same friendly and loving cat. 

We then decided to bring a new kitten rescue into our home bc we had seen she did well with tigger in the past. We kept her and the new kitten separated at first and let her smell underneath the bathroom door where we kept the kitten and she did hiss at first but eventually she got over it and they started to play and even sleep together.

In early March, we left NYC to stay with my mom again due to the pandemic. We brought both phoebe and the new kitten.

All of the wires, drawstrings, shoelaces in the house have either been destroyed or removed. In the past, I‚Äôve noticed a bored dog is destructive, so to combat this they always get showered with toys and several playtimes.

 With one of my two cats, I have a problem with her being extremely demanding (and vocal).  Basically, when she wants something, she has to have it, and throws a tantrum until she gets it.

That ""something"" can be:

* wanting food

* going outside (she is indoor/outdoor)

* wanting to cuddle

When she wants something, she starts meowing incessantly, eventually turning it into howling.  She also (cleverly) finds any method she can make to make noise- banging on her food bowl, scratching at the floor or door, etc.  Anything that will get her attention, even negative.

I try very hard not to reward it, but she doesn't stop, so eventually the behavior gets reinforced.  (For example, if she never stops meowing for food, for hours, eventually she'll get food while meowing.)

This behavior has gotten MUCH worse lately as I have been working from home so she finds ways to get my attention (even just because she wants to be pet).  Even if I keep two levels of doors away (close the hallway and office doors), if she goes outside she'll go to the window of the office and start banging on the window with her paws if I ignore the meows.

I'm starting with the basic ""come"" command in attempts to train the clicker in tandem with the trick. Having a lot of problem with reward. I see youtube training videos where the cats just follow the food around, my kittens definitely don't do this.

The girl kitten is the friendlier of the two. She'll sometimes come when called and I've found the reward of a certain wet food that she seems to enjoy. Only thing is, she'll frequently just pass up the food for no reason at all when she does finally come after a while of coaxing. I feel this is going to make associating the reward with a clicker difficult. I've just started meal feeding off of free feeding today as that was my first theory for why she's so uninterested in the wet food reward. That took her from not wanting to eat off the spoon at all to sometimes licking it off, but it still seems to take way more coaxing than necessary. I see potential in being able to eventually train her.  Maybe play is a better reward for her? She's obsessed with her worm on a stick.

For the other boy kitten, he doesn't even come to me. I'm pretty convinced he still distrusts me, its been 2 weeks and the guy still hisses at me for no reason (I'm very careful to be slow, quiet as possible, avoiding direct eye contact, slow blinks, all that). He obviously loves this wet food, when I did a sampler of 6 foods, this stuff was the one he ate nearly half a can of in one sitting. And after I fill his bowl with it and leave, he's all over that stuff (smart camera, so I know for sure). But he won't eat off a spoon at all and generally just avoids me like the plague. I currently can't see any way to train this guy. His last vet visit was 2 weeks ago, I can't believe he's still harboring trauma over that. I don't know if play could be a reward for him. The only thing he cares for is the laser pointer, and sometimes the Catit circuit, but that's not something I can easily take away and give as a reward. Issue with the laser pointer is both kittens will chase after it, so I don't know how I could use it to just reward the boy. This guy has just been acting like a butthole since he's got home, and I'd really like to start training as a way to warm him up.

When we get her this cat door 5~ days ago, she's been very skittish around it. If the flap moves, she does that little jolt motion. She will go through the cat door if the door itself is propped open all the wall and is encouraged with treats.

When left alone: She usually cries because she 'can't' get out (but will eventually leave if again, door is open)

She will flip out if picked up and put by the door, and usually stays away from the door by 2ish feet or more. BUT will get close if led by treats. I even got her to touch the door a few times by letting her eat treats off of it, but as soon as she gets the treat she backs away a bit to eat it.

She will get close to the door on her own every so often to touch it with her paw cautiously, sniff it. But will not go through if the door is shut.

I'm unaware of her age and if that plays a factor in this training.

For now I'll keep putting treats on/by the door and her food bowl to make her eat near it (has done so once but ate slowly).

Things were rough at first but we followed Jackson Galaxy's guide to introductions and we are now in a place where we can have them out together. They do well eating and during parallel play, but we are experiencing two problems.

1. They will not nap and or relax around each other. When it becomes clear they need a nap, I have to take O into the sanctuary room and close the door. They are both in their beds and asleep within minutes after I do this. 
2. P feels the need to follow O around CONSTANTLY and it annoys him. Today he was entertaining himself, carrying toy mouses around, doing kitten stuff, and she was just in his face the whole time. He eventually growled at her so we separated them for nap time.

YuuMeliodas,1589268720,gi6hsi,2,False,1,"So I have two cats, boys, one is 1 year and 4 months old, the other 7 months. The younger one, Beanie, won't listen to ""No"" no matter what I've tried. I haven't been sleeping for 4 days because of his behavior now and I have tried many things before but it just get's worse. For example he keeps going behind my monitor and knocks it over (I can't mount it on the wall or fixate it to the desk), if I block the part on my desk where I keep some important stuff I need daily for work he just goes at it for hours until either he removes the block or I get tired/have to do other things to remove him from there. 

I tried spraying with water when saying ""No"" loud and clear, I tried locking him out of the room for hours on end sometimes (allthough it comes with massive stress on my other cat, he has some issues with closed doors from a trauma), I tried treats when he listens for once, played with him to make him forget about his mischief but he just goes right back to it after playing, he doesn't care about water or aluminum foil, he actually likes it, I bonked him softly on the head (I'm very careful because I'm scared to hurt him) which also didn't work. I'm at my wits end and I just want to sleep and work in peace again.

My other cat is well behaved most of the time and I have no idea what I can do to make Beanie understand what No means. He usually is not an aggressive cat but needs a lot of playtime everyday, which I provide, so I'm not sure what else to do. I play with him until he pants (about 10 minutes letting him chase and run full-speed through the house, with climbing sessions on the cat trees inbetween), then give him some breathing room for an hour or two and then play again since he demands it pretty frequently.

AnInMoon,1589221416,ght7u4,0,False,1,"This behavior is most probably because of unspent energy. My roommate is literally never home, but when he‚Äôs home he never plays with the cat. He also doesn‚Äôt buy the cat any toys, no cat tree, no scratch post, no other cats to play with, no nothing. The only thing he provides for the cat is food and litter box. He thinks the cat is self-sufficient because she never bothers him like she does me, and it‚Äôs driving me insane.

This cat is about one year old and probably hasn‚Äôt been around other cats much so she doesn‚Äôt know how to act socially. Every time I come out of my room she will run toward me like a zubat and starts rubbing herself on my legs. That‚Äôs sweet and all but as soon as I start walking she will cling onto me to rub even more, digging her nails onto me and getting in the way of my walking. I have accidentally stepped on her and almost tripped myself multiple times, but she won‚Äôt stop doing it. Then when I don‚Äôt give her the attention, she will jump to catch my hands/legs and this always results in scratches on my body. If not then she will starts biting or scratching my feet; this behavior will get more aggressive if I move, as if she thinks I‚Äôm playing with her. I‚Äôve yelped in pain but she still won‚Äôt stop doing it, and spraying water at her does literally nothing. 

I‚Äôve also tried buying a cheap laser pen to play with her but she never seems to get tired. After 30 minutes she won‚Äôt chase after the laser anymore but as soon as I walk away she will run toward me and bite me again. So I gave up playing with her. I shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for spending money on her toys or playing with her, but I tried anyway and it still doesn‚Äôt stop her neediness. When I have no other solution and can‚Äôt calm her down, I will put her in his room so I can cook and do stuff but I think this only makes her madder.

I‚Äôve asked my roommate multiple times to buy her a cat tree because she always jumps on top of the fridge, or on the kitchen counter and sits on my drying mat. He still doesn‚Äôt buy her anything or even puts in the slightest effort to play with her.

So my cat has started peeing on random spots on the floor.

When it moved back down to the second floor she started peeing on the bathroom rugs (the new ones, and the ones in the bathroom that never changed). After a little while of having to constantly wash the rugs we started putting them up (hanging them on the bathtub etc) so she stopped that. Now we have moved the litter boxes into the basement (from the second floor) and she just pees all over the floor down there. Her sister (same litter) is perfectly fine with the new setup and seems to have no problems. We don't know if she is only peeing on the floor, or if she is also peeing in the litter box.  Same diet and everything as her sister, we have two cat food bowls that we fill about 1/4 cup each. They don't fight over food and even though they switch between bowls regularly they both eat the same amount. We give both of them plenty of attention and play with them regularly. Besides moving the litter boxes (my mum has added like a half dozen since this started, since we have no idea what else to do) nothing else has changed.

tl:dr my stray-ish cat always loudly demanding to go outside and I don't know how I should help her be happier in my house. 

Basically, I live in a house with 4 other roommates  in a quite suburban cul de sac type place. Since before I moved in, this one particular stray cat is just always in the house. She doesn't really look or act like a stray, she's very clean and i've never seen her fight with all the other strays that live in our area, she's just always in our house like it's always been her house. My guess is the people who used to live here left her here? She's very easygoing, never bites or scratches, lets people carry her with no problem, likes cuddles, totally acts like someones housecat. My roommates would buy food for her but let her come and go as she pleases, but i know it isn't really good to have outside cats (not really worried about her killing birds since she...  first of all is not good at it but also theres lots of cats here, not really any busy road or car risk, just like... parasites and I don't want her in the cold and rain).  I decided I want to just keep her permanently since none of our neighbours know anything about her either, but I can't take her to the vet yet because covid.. 

Anyway, because until now people just let her come and go as she wanted, she always wants to go outside to run around... and she is not quiet about it. She will come to my bedroom door at night (she has her own bed she likes more in the hall) and cry until it wakes me up, then run to the back door and sit there meowing until I let her out. I try playing with her inside and she's not interested... I try sitting outside to watch her  in just our yard but she will jump up over the fence as soon as she can.. and she just won't give up because she always gets to get let out eventually by screaming for so long. If I lived alone I would just get ear plugs but everyone in my house except me are still working and need to sleep.. 

She is always meowing super loud at everything all the time, I guess she's just chatty which I don't mind except when I'm sleeping or when she's trying to leave... This is so rambling I guess I just want advice on what I should do? is there any way to help her be come comfortable as an indoor cat? She happily sleeps in here all day and suddenly she decides she needs to be outside..she doesn't even play with the other cats out there she just walks around I think. she's not hungry either.. The reason I think she needs to stay indoors is also because I'm worried if I move into an apartment it'll be  a harder change for her to get used to it then than if i do it now in a house she knows...

When I start a training session with my cat, she really has a hard time to calm down before I can give her an order. She's begging for the treat by meowing or bumping her head on my legs or my hands.

pinkestspace,1587690470,g6z228,22,False,1,"Every morning at 5am one of my cats will come under the bed and to the top of the mattress and claw at it, he claws at it so hard that it always wakes my partner and I up. This cat is usually very good with scratching at his scratching posts, so we believe it is because he wants to wake us up. We have tried ignoring this behaviour and spraying him with water. Nothing seems to work and every morning we are getting woken up. I am a uni student and only work casually, I have lost my job due to Covid-19 so I have always been around the cats, giving them attention and playing with them. 

The other cat is really obsessed with water that we will paw at the bowl until it all spills out (we keep the bowl in the bath for easy clean up), however, once he has pawed out all the water he moves the plastic bowl around the bath tub causing the plastic to rub against the bathtub until one of us fills it back up, and the process continues. I have recently put the water in the shower as he also scratches around the water bowl and has scratched the bathtub pretty bad. The shower is connected to the top of the shower screen but not the bottom and it has three panels so if you push on the panel it bangs against the other three. Although we leave the shower door open, he will bang the shower doors together at night, last night he woke us up at 2am doing this, so I closed the bathroom door. He then started scratching at the bathroom door. I moved his water to the kitchen and showed him it was there but he was still scratching at the bathroom door.  As I write this post he jumped up on my desk and put his paw in my glass causing it to spill everywhere. I'm not sure where this fascination has come from.

The thing is they only do these behaviours at night when my partner and I are sleeping. And the thing is, they know they're doing the wrong thing because as soon as I move in bed to get up and spray them with water they run away and hide. 

My partner and I have had cats all our lives and we love them but we have never had cats that cause as much mischief as these two. I should probably add that they are about 1 1/2 years old and are brothers. I found them in my car park at work when they were about 5 weeks old.

We lived in a rural area where this was pretty normal, we got to foster the four kittens while the owners of the mother were on vacation. 

The problem started when we moved five years ago to a more urban area, where we didn‚Äôt allow them outside anymore. They started to fight each other, they both started it, it wasn‚Äôt that one was egging the other on. When the other came into the room, or training to get on to the cat tree we have.

Hi everyone! My family's cat loves to eat but we've started to notice he is getting pretty heavy and want to help him lose a few pounds. He is a shorthair cat about 7 or 8 years old and is about 14 pounds. First off, do you think that his current weight is too high?

He is free-fed but for some reason always wants his food bowl to be full. If food is pushed to the sides of the bowl and he can see the bottom, we have to shake the bowl or give him more so he stops meowing. I feel like he is extremely spoiled because of this but his meowing is so irritating so I give in to his crying and feed him more. When this happens at night, he will claw at my door until I get up and feed him. Sometimes I get irritated and put him outside but he just cries at my window until I let him in again. Any advice is appreciated. This cat just seems to love attention, even if it's waking us up in the middle of the night just for us to watch him eat when his bowl is already full.

Hi. I'm having serious problems with one of my cats. I have 4 in total.

To give a bit of context, our first can was not very welcoming of her but after a while they were ok, then we found and stayed with 2 little kittens that the older one adopted has her children, and the second cat didn't particullarly enjoy the company of. I think this is important because it might be jealousy or attention because she is incredibly cuddly and is always aroud my mother, in particular. We have tried tinfoil and pepper, pepper worked for sometime but has lost it's effect. We are getting to a point were the wood of the house is starting to become rotten.

Our family room is above our kitchen, and has a half-wall/ledge surrounding it so you can look over the kitchen. Behind this ledge is a 10-15 foot drop into the kitchen. We also have a spiral staircase with a small square landing in the family room that has now become the problem area. Previously it was the far end of the ledge as in the middle we have our couch which she doesn‚Äôt jump on or even bother with, although I am concerned that she will start to try to get to the ledge by jumping from the area behind the couch as it reclines. Anyways, over the course of yesterday and today she has become enamored with the ledge and keeps making attempts, just at night so far, to become an acrobat. It terrifies me and my family and is getting tiring to worry and have to lure her off the edge with treats. Our home is a rental, so any super involved solutions with screws, nails, etc are out of the picture, as well as the classic tin foil/sticky tape approach. We are too nervous that this will scare her and make her fall off, as she can be a little bit clumsy and can get nervous/spooked pretty easily. If this matters, for the past few weeks a neighboring cat has been visiting her through our glass back door, and we aren‚Äôt sure if they are friends or not or somewhere in between. She does yowl at him and ‚Äúattacks‚Äù the door sometimes, but at other times they just sit and look at each other. I‚Äôm not sure if these behaviors are related or not. Tonight, she successfully climbed in the ledge once and attempted several more times, once in the far end and the rest on the stairwell. We scared her off for these attempts. We don‚Äôt know what to do and are very scared for her. Our only solution now was to place many objects on the ledge to keep her off/from jumping on it. She loves being with us and sitting on window ledges, but this behavior is heavily unsafe. I just started with basic clicked training a few days ago as well.

kimcharlotti,1586570764,fyu9cn,4,False,1,"We have adopted a 1yr old cat 3 weeks ago and eventhough is character is great he gives us some troubles with scratchimg and biting. 

The background of this cat: We adopted him from a lady who wanted him as a companion to her first cat. They didnt get alog at all and our cat ended up having to move asap as they were fightig very seriously. This lady told us he is a nice  indoor cat who is playful. She adopted him from anpther lady who had to give him up after a year as she couldnt make enough time for him. We made the dicision to adopt him as he is used to being inside only, our appartment is larger than the one he is used to. Also we decided to adopt him without a companion as he has shown that he has difficulties with other cats.

As we are home minimum of 20 hours/day my boyfriend and I play with him taking turns. He properly sprints 3 times a day for like 5-10 minutes. We play with different toys, mainly cat fishing rods but also laser pointer, bouncy balls, fish toys etc. Probably 2 hours each. Plus we feed him using a clicker as we are in the phase of conditioning him. This is another 2x 15 mins a day. We have already leash trained him and he gets to explore the attic on a leash for about 20 mins a day. He has got a lot of toys around the apartment and also we have lots of shelfs just for him to walk on and claw scratching places. 

He is very social and loves to be where we are. He talks to us quiet a lot and always greets us when he or we enter the room. As soon as we do something around the apartment he will be there to join us. Also he sleeps in a chair next to the bed  so we think he probably likes us and doesnt see us as a treat. He has never been scared as we leave him be if he does not want to be interrupted or is in his ""safe zones"". 

Now here is the problem. He attacks us but mainly me in different ways. As i am sitting at the kitchen table (but also as i am walking around) he will just out of nowhere start biting and scratching my feet in this typical cat way. He will wrap his body around my foot so he can grab them with his front paws and scratch them with his back paws, at the same time he bites. This is not playful biting, we are talking proper biting! I have read i need to react and say ""no"" in a determined way and i will look him in the eye. He stops (usually). And i will walk away. If he bites me while i pet him i will do the same, walk away. 

Sometimes when i say ""no"" he takes this and looking in the eye in a wrong way as he will leap forward and attack my body/face/head/shoulders... whatever is closest. Again biting sown really hard. I then need to grab him and push him off me. You can imagine how my body looks. When i get him there is no way for me to get away without him leaping/ attavking me again so i need to put him down and shut some door between us (always so he has access to his safe zones).  

We are starting to think that our cat is highly social and needs lots of interaction. Maybe thats why he didnt get along with the other cat, he was just annoing. And the first owner must have given him away as he demands a higg amount of play time and that must have been too much. 

We really dont know how to stop the attacks as we give him lots of attention. Once we start working again in the office we will not be able to play with him 5 hours per day, we were thinking more like 2 hours. We are concerned as we are obviously doing something wrong as he seems to get aggressiv. Maybe he is still in play mode but the bitkng is too hard for it to be playful.

Bonnie, the female cat, broke her right fang tooth a month ago and had to have it removed. When we brought her back from the vet after the surgery, she was of course groggy from the anesthetic.

Ever since then, they have not been able to be in the same room. At first, Clyde was extremely aggressive towards Bonnie, and would attack her when she came too close. Over the next days, Bonnie also started acting aggressive towards him.

We have two other cats that are 9-10 months old, as well as an elderly cat. The three young cats play a ton, chasing each other around the house batting around toys, playing in cat tunnels, wrestling, etc. The elderly cat is retired and just chills.   

Everything seemed to be going well until two nights ago. In the middle of the night, new cat decided to wrap himself around my husband‚Äôs head, purring loudly and licking / grooming him. If my husband tried to remove the cat, he would bite (gently). Eventually my husband got up and gently removed the cat from the bedroom, locking him out for the rest of the night.

The next night, we made an effort to wear him out before bed. We fed everyone their wet food dinner around 9:30 pm. Then we did a long, intense play session with a fishing-pole style toy with all three of the young kitties over the course of the next hour. When we went to bed, the three young kitties continued playing by running up and down the carpeted stairs together (a favorite game of theirs).

I think I need your help.

We have two lovely cats (male, fixed, 1.5 yrs old, had them for over a year). One of them, Sans, needs significantly more attention from us than the other. He particularly enjoys when we play with him or let him look out of the open window under our supervision. Sans sometimes jumps up a certain cupboard and meows until we pay him attention and then he usually tries to lead us to the window or to a toy he has tossed somewhere he can't reach.

The cats like each other, play and play-fight with each other, but Sans often gets a little too rough.

Usually, the cats are alone for a few hours a day while both my partner and me are at work. 

However, due to the current circumstances, both my partner and I are working from home. In the past 1.5 weeks, Sans has at times driven us close to insanity because he wanted so much attention. When we both work, especially when we both are in a video chat at the same time, he jumps on the cupboard and meows, then howls, then starts to push stuff off the cupboard to get our attention. When we play or window-watch with him, he only stays content for maybe 15 minutes afterwards before starting to yell for more attention or attacking the second cat (which often leads to the second cat hissing and screaming and us separating them).

We let him look out the window several times a day for 10-15 minutes each. In addition, I clicker-train both cats, we play with Sans - using different toys - multiple times a day. He has many different toys and he sometimes also plays by himself (he especially likes kicking small items around on the floor). I've also tried walking him on a leash outside. He enjoys it, but he can't ever get enough (when we got back inside, he jumped on the windowsill and yelled at us).

It wasn't nearly that exhausting when we both worked away from home and when he only saw us constantly on weekends.

Sans really is a sweetheart and I am confident that he's happy with us, but I don't know what do to both help him ease his boredom or dissatisfaction and also have some time to get work done.

Ainychus,1584727916,flzq2t,20,False,1,"I have a nearly 11 month old cat called Raven. He's a very sweet cat, neutered and very big too. He trusts me completely and is generally a docile thing.

Now this  cat is absolutely obsessed with his food. I've started feeding him on a schedule and it's helped cull some of the behavior, although I did wake up to an utterly shredded packet of treats this morning, and he's lost some of his chub, but I still feel like he isn't getting enough exercise. He mainly sleeps all day, he doesn't go outside often, and when he does go out he's too scared to explore, he usually hides somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I personally would really like to take him for walks on a harness. I think it would be perfect excercise for cat and owner alike, it would initiate bonding, and it could give him some confidence (he's a very, very timid cat.) 

My mother has made it clear that she's against the idea. She believes that, with the large number of dogs and dog owners in our country, we would encounter too many dogs and it would stress him out and scare him. She believes that his timidity is what keeps him alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't agree. Our neighbors own a huge Bernese mountain dog with a loud voice, and on a few occasions Raven has had the shred of confidence to approach her somewhat when he was with me. In fact, I was holding him with his back legs dangling down, and the dog who's usually as timid as Raven approached me and started trying to sniff his back paws. To my surprise the cat stayed perfectly still instead of struggling; likely knowing he needed to stay with me to stay safe. And if he knows that, then I don't think it'll be a huge problem.

When we adopted him, we were living in an apartment but we didn‚Äôt give him entire free reign of the house due to a roommate we had gotten a week after getting the cat that had a cat allergy, so he mostly stayed in our room.

However, pretty much every single night since we moved in, the cat meows like crazy, runs around the room, and pounds on the bedroom door with his paw, causing it to rattle.

It has been his favorite toy to play with and has been a good bonding experience for the both of us. However once he catches the toy in his mouth and keeps his hold on it he begins to meow quite loudly. At this point his back is arched or he flops to his side with one leg raised and I can tell he‚Äôs got a boner.

saucy_shark,1583640049,ff74vb,20,False,1,"Hey folks, so at this point I'm pretty much grasping for straws when it comes to my boyfriend's cat and would appreciate any advice you have to offer.

The cat is just about a year old, purely indoors and he has been neutered. I suspect he was separated from his mother and siblings a little too early and this has had an effect on a lot of his behaviours. My boyfriend got him as a kitten and while he was always very playful and a bit aggressive from the beginning, these issues only worsen as he gets older and bigger.

He's very aggressive. We often can't really have a peaceful moment in the house as he frequently likes to attack us both completely out of left field. He targets our hands and feet, but especially hands. He honestly seems to think hands have committed an atrocity on him and his ancestors. My boyfriend and I have uncountable scratches and wounds and he draws blood on the regular. 

He has moments where he is incredibly affectionate, normally when we wake up in the morning and we let him in the room, or whenever either of us come home from being out for extended periods of time. However, it only lasts about 5 minutes before attack mode turns on.

I believe his intentions are playful at the start, but he works himself up into actual anger when we react negatively to him. At that point I genuinely become a little frightened and have to forcibly remove him from the room by picking him up by the scruff so he doesn't attack us more.

He also jumps up onto surfaces I don't want him on, including kitchen benches and computer desks and eating surfaces. Whenever we open the fridge he will insert himself between the fridge and the open door and will not move, I have to physically remove him. I also might as well mention that he likes to suckle on the tip of his tail, until it's sopping wet (I realise this isn't necessarily a bad behaviour, but it might be worth mentioning).

He has an incredible amount of toys with a huge variety, pretty much every cat toy type that you could imagine and a scratching post. However, he prefers to play with things he isn't supposed to such as cords and things that are for humans and not for cats. We have to lock him in another room when we use our computers because he will run amok around the area, biting cords, attacking our hands and feet, climbing on the keyboard etc. and just do very attention-seeking behaviour in general. He knows he isn't supposed to be doing these things but I think he enjoys getting a rise out of us for sure.

We've tried all sorts of both positive and negative reinforcements. Giving treats when he's good, or petting (he will normally bite us when we pet him), spray bottle, firmly saying ""no!"", yelling, hissing, tapping his nose, citrus sprays. Negative reinforcements genuinely just seem to piss him off even more. Nowadays we just remove him from the room and let him chill out for 20 minutes, but he will start up again not long after we let him out. 

I also play with him with the laser pointer every day as that's his favourite toy, and he will run around chasing it like crazy until he pants like a dog. His energy is literally boundless and he would continue chasing and stalking the laser for hours if we had time to play with him for that long, but the reality is that we don't. I feel like perhaps we just can't keep up with his energy levels and he has figured out that bad behaviours will get him attention, even if it's negative. But to be honest, it's hard playing with the cat when he hurts and annoys you all the time and you start to resent him for it. It's been easier for us to keep him in seperate rooms for multiple hours of the day, as he actually sits quietly and doesn't destroy anything if we aren't looking (???).

The biggest problems are that she‚Äôs so intent on food, she acts as hungry as she was before she was dx with diabetes when it was unmanaged, running around underfoot while I (or family members) put the food in bowls for the cats. She runs back and forth, meowing frantically. She‚Äôs clawed and bit my mother a few times, I didn‚Äôt witness it so I can‚Äôt say why she did that. She‚Äôs clawed me once on accident while running back and forth. Her tail fluffs up and she can get defensive/offensive? if she‚Äôs close enough to the other cats. Her behavior stresses out the other cats, hence the feeding separately when possible. It‚Äôs also stressful not knowing what‚Äôs best to do in this situation and just keeping in doing something that doesn‚Äôt seem to work. 

I believe it‚Äôs possible her food related behaviors were exasperated by her diabetes, but there was a time of about 8 months where she didn‚Äôt act like this.

She is exceptionally food motivated and will always jump up on the bench when we are preparing any food (even cereal isn't safe), and usually for a couple of hours after we've cleaned up, presumably looking for scraps! 

We tried the old water spray trick, but after reading more into it we stopped relying on it (I don't want her to be afraid of us!), and I suggested we pick her up nicely and move her to her cat tower when she's on the bench. We even sporadically place treats up there and tap on it as positive reinforcement (and associate the taps with treats). After trying this for a while, we haven't had much success - she usually just jumps down, and back onto the bench. Even the water spray, when we do use it, only lasts for about 30 seconds before she's back up. 

Alfoil has sort of worked, but is messy and gets in the way when cooking dinner, so I end up becoming irritated and tearing it off again. We've also tried physical barriers (i.e. stacking things up around the bench that she physically can't jump over) but again, messy and not good long term. It wouldn't take her long to figure out the barriers are gone, once we do remove them. 

We feed her well, usually we cook after she has eaten, so I doubt she is truly hungry. She particularly likes the sink - both empty and clean, and I've had to grab her out of the dirty dishwater more than once.

When my boyfriend moved in a month and a half ago he brought his cat Ruby. She‚Äôs the queen of the household and she knows it. 

I have two male cats and have recently gotten a golden puppy (I know it‚Äôs not a great time but I put down my deposit a long time ago and he is so far pretty amazing with cats). 

Ruby was introduced to Torby (my 7 y.o) through door feeding, but while I was out of the house my boyfriend opened the door and she really went for my cat, she made his ear bleed. We also have one of those feliway defusers.

My other cat barely comes home except for midnight but then I‚Äôm in bed because I have work. I‚Äôm in the middle of getting a tracking collar because I need some way of getting him to come home at night. 

Because I‚Äôm home far more often than my boyfriend I know how bad Ruby‚Äôs behaviour is. She will go out of her way to approach Torby and hiss and growl at him. At first I would make a sharp ‚ÄúARGH‚Äù noise and shoo her to the bedroom which was her safe haven (we‚Äôve moved her to the other side of the house two nights ago as we brought Bentley home).

The shelter said he was found in a feral den, unable to walk due to injuries. He grew really friendly to humans as they rehabilitated him. From the second we met him, he‚Äôs been the friendliest cat we‚Äôve ever met. He seeks out pets and shows us his belly and likes to get tummy rubs every day. 

Toby bonded with me very quickly, as I stay at home. He sits on my lap and makes biscuits often. He boops his nose on my nose. Everything has been pretty great. However, recently my husband and I got really busy with a show and had less time to play with Toby. During that period, Toby started to pounce on me and bite my arms at night while I was sleeping. I chalked it up to excess energy from lack of attention. 

However, the show is over and we‚Äôve resumed our previous playtime schedule (three times a day and play until he‚Äôs literally panting and flops on the ground) but the nighttime attacks have gotten worse. He seriously rips the covers off of me and attacks my arms and legs. When he attacks he‚Äôll wrap his arms around my limbs and hold tight and bite. He doesn‚Äôt hiss or claw, but I can‚Äôt tell if this is some type of ‚Äúplay‚Äù or if he‚Äôs trying to murder my arms. When he does this I calmly carry him out of the room and shut the door (he hates this and meows for hours when he‚Äôs locked out)

Today, after he attacked my head last night and got booted, I woke up and he sought pets like he usually does but then he stopped and looked me in the eyes and stood up on his hindquarters, put his ears back and hissed and swatted at me! I calmly disengaged and ignored him, but I‚Äôm concerned that I‚Äôve somehow become the target of aggression that will continue to grow unless I figure out another strategy to stop it. Just seconds after he did this, he was back to being attention seeking and trying to make biscuits on my legs. I continued to ignore him for another 30 min or so. I plan on leaving him locked out of our room tonight because I worry he will literally try to eat me.

Once we got our third, the male and the new female bonded and eventually the male and original female started fighting. The male typically stalks and then attacks her, fur flying, scratches and yowling and hissing. It's super stressful as cat parents trying to find solutions not to mention stressful to the both of them.

We have a small town home, though when we originally were in a larger home, they still had issues. There are two litter boxes, multiple scratching posts and several ""spots"" they like to all frequent. They are lightly territorial of their favorite spots but it doesn't typically cause fights, only passive aggressive behavior unless they're in a ""mood"". All of our cats are extremely food driven. They are very loud and chaotic around feeding time and always have been. They are schedule fed because they eat raw food and don't have self control with dry food. 

The original female doesn't typically behave quite the same way the other two cats do. Likely due to the fighting but she has always been more outgoing and rambunctious and derpy which may be her acting out because of the fighting. The fights happen maybe once a day, unless the male is quite perturbed, he will sometimes have to go in time out so he can cool down. He goes in a crate which they enjoy being in so it's not a punishment so much as separation without being shut in a room alone which they hate. It seems that a lot of his aggression is attention related. He is very responsive to words and tone of voice. 

 I know that redirection and positive reinforcement is best with cats but for this, it's hard to know what to positively reinforce and how. Treats don't work because they all freak out over food that they lose total sense of what's going on and focus on the treat.  

I'm also at a loss of what to do when they are in the middle of fighting? Since it gets to a point where the female will have scratches on her face and ears, I worry letting them just ""sort it out"" because she usually gets cornered.

We‚Äôre not sure why she‚Äôs doing it, she uses the litter box fine, the peeing starts always like an hour before we have our alarms set so it jolts is awake. 

One of her medications increases her water intake and urination but it didn‚Äôt start when she started that medicine... there was maybe a two/three week delay. 

We recently moved to a new place but that was several months prior to all this. 

She‚Äôs been quarantined to our room (which has an attached bath where her litter box and food are), as she was peeing in the laundry room and pooping outside the other bedroom doors. 

Only thing left is her peeing in the morning. It‚Äôs disruptive and is making us exhausted. How can we stop her from doing this? 

All the extra-litterbox nonsense started after her medical scare. (She lost her vision and could not walk or move). Her vision is back albeit with some spotting, and the vet has cleared her as as healthy as a cat her age can be. 

Please let me know if you need any additional details!

francesrainbow,1578860126,enspjc,5,False,1,"Background: I have been living with my boyfriend for about a year now but the problems have been there since we first started going out a few months before that.


His cat, who is ¬ø8? years old today (it's his birthday), goes through phases of ignoring / just co-existing with me, to then being more affectionate, to then RANDOMLY ATTACKING ME (pouncing at my legs / arms to bite and/or scratch), and then being kind of neutral again. 


I have never had a cat so it's entirely possible that I've done / am doing something that's provoking him but I don't know what. I hate not being able to wear short pyjamas in my own home for fear of my legs getting scratched. I'm getting better at reading his body language so can sometimes tell when he's acting up but he bit my hand there while I was reading on the couch and it really hurt me.


We've got a citrusy spray that gets used when he attacks, and he also gets shut out of the room, but my concern is that he's not a kitten and we've been trying these things for a year now and I don't know that there's been any obvious improvement.  If there are kids in my partner and my future I am NOT having a cat that randomly attacks things in the house (but none of that's certain at the moment).

I'm thinking of recording the frequency of cat attacks to monitor any improvement in behaviour, but would  really, really, really value any helpful training advice you can share. My boyfriend worries that if the cat doesn't behave he'll have to go to a cattery and get put down :(

TheDiddler2049,1578743266,en6ind,0,False,1,"Hi guys! So yesterday I got a kitten from the shelter, a lovely little guy who has been socialised around other cats. I brought him home and kept him in his own room for the day, once he had gotten used to it and wanted to explore I put him in the cats area, and put my cat in the kittens room.





Once the cat and kitten seemed okay with each other's smells (both were sniffing the others litter boxes, no raised fur or hissing) I introduced them. They were fine, no raised fur or hissing. Both were chasing each other equally. 





The only thing im concerned about is, is my kitten annoying my cat? The cat went to his bed on his tree and the kitten walked under the bed, the cat killed off the tree and ran around with the kitten. I did notice the cats pupils were dilated and he was staring at the kitten. The kitten walked away and lay down away from him.

HolaZolaa,1578739339,en5zp4,1,False,1,"Sorry if this isnt the right place to ask this, i just can't seem to find anywhere that someone's asked a similar question..

My cat is about 3 yrs old and since he was  about 1 yr he's had this crazy attachment to water. It worries me sometimes because he will sit there drinking for 3-8 minutes straight like he's been starved of water for days but he obviously hasn't. and We had gotten our second cat 2yrs ago so having the two of them now We use a free water bowl with a gallon reservoir for the times we are at work.

But our other cat doesnt show this behavior with the water &amp; ive never seen it in other cats so it makes me wonder if something may be wrong? 
He is overweight, but small despite being 3yrs. and every time i've tried to mention this behavior at our vet they never really give me an answer and brush it off as him being thirsty.
But im just concerned; has anyone else experienced this behavior?

We've tried the water dispensers to make sure he has ample water and isn't going thirsty, but unless distracted or sleeping he just drinks and pees alot and drinks alot again.
So we've tried limiting it to a bowl throughout the day refilling it as needed and such. But this method causes him to whine like crazy and even though he's drank nearly all of it we have to keep him back sometimes so he doesn't keep our other cat from drinking any. Even when doing separate water bowls he'll finish his and try to get the other as well. Similar to food possessiveness i guess
We've also started feeding more wet food this past year to add even more moisture to his diet in hopes that would help, but so far no improvement.
Has anyone else seen this behavior and have any advice? He'll be due for another vet visit in a few weeks so im going to ask again but every other time i've asked they didnt feel it was in need of concern...
but with they way he acts with it could it be something more than just being a normal thirsty... or am i looking into it too much and its a behavioral correction that's needed?",CatTraining,Can a cat be drinking too much?

He is trained to use the liter and has been for all his life

Since my gfs things are pretty safe she doesn't see a problem with the cat doing this and now I'm up at 4am cleaning the toys I can and throwing out the ones I can't clean.  

This behaviour has been going on for a good year now and is about a year and a half old. The cat receives nothing but love and pets from my son and his owner but no discipline from anybody as it was clear I would not have anything to do with it since I really did not want pets.

Just to add there has been a younger rescue cat that is a scaredy cat but he is a good cat.

I am on my last straw because i was clear i did not want an animal but now i am stuck cleaning after it. And so I need some tips on how to handle this.

I've had him since kitten, and he has been living with me in a few different apartments along the years, and always been quick to adapt to his new home. However, he have always had acess to the outdoors, but still knows how to use a litterbox. He does however tend to poop outside the litterbox on carpets or doormats, whenever the litterbox is full (or not there).
Last month we've been living in a new apartment, and letting him out is an annoying task of 3 doors and an apartment stairwell. Being both pregnant and mom to a toddler, having daily litterbox duties is something I'd love to minimize.
So I got one of those toiletseat litterboxes that can teach your cat to use a human toilet. He had no problem using it as the regular litterbox when it was on the floor the usual place (shower cabin), and once placed on the toilet I've finally managed to show him that its safe to jump up, using a target stick and clicking with treats. He seems very confident jumping up and down, and now knows where the litterbox is placed. 
Still no luck making him actually use it though. We've had two accidents so far, in terms of poop. No idea if he have actually peed since the litterbox was moved to the toilet (a discovery yet to be found), but he's very good at holding it in. 
Its still new and we haven't tried for many days so far, but I'm not sure if there is more to be done here. Pooping on carpets has always been his go to, when nothing else seems to be an option, and I fear that will continue to be his option as long as the litterbox isn't placed as usual.",CatTraining,Human-toilet training an old cat

I feed all the animals, clean cat boxes, cuddle, nail clipping, grooming, doctor, and play with the animals. Essentially anything to do with any of the pets is on me 98% of the time. I also have 2 dogs, 2 kids who are at the house 1/2 the time, and a boyfriend.

So over the last year, I periodically have found cat pee on my dirty clothes basket or the shared family dirty clothes basket. They are in our bedroom, so I figured maybe someone got locked in and really had to go. Well 2 days ago I folded my clothes and left them in the basket over night. Cat #1 uses this as her cat bad 1/2 the time even though there's a giant dog bed next to there she also frequently uses. üôÑ

The next day when I was putting my clothes away I noticed a wet spot on the bottom of the basket, further investigation it was cat pee. A cat had peed half in and half out of the basket.

My middle aged cat Kissa sleeps in my room every night, because cuddling with me means lots of scratches! I just moved my room downstairs into the basement, however (I live with my family) and I‚Äôm wondering in what ways I could get her to naturally go downstairs into my room for bedtime. She keeps going to my old room out of habit of course. My old room is eventually going to be empty and probably a storage room,  so I want to make sure she‚Äôs acclimated to my bedroom  downstairs and knows to come

So anyway, my roommate (25F) got a kittens not a month ago.  She is not nearly responsible enough for a kitten, but I digress.  The kitten is the most unruly tiny beast I have never seen.  He jumps on the counter and steals the food I‚Äôm cooking the *second* I turn around to stir a pan.    If you put him down, he jumps right back up immediately and will continue to fight and swat for the food even as I‚Äôm shooing him away.  He‚Äôs immune to the water spray bottle.

This cat was rehomed to us after being in a stable house for 11yrs. This is her first time leaving. We've had her for two days. She will walk around pacing and crying. She has full food bowls both dry and wet. Litter pan is clean. She is eating and drinking and using potty. We are playing with her before bed. We are giving plenty of attention. She seems nervous and anxious which is normal for a recently rehomed cat. I tried CBD to calm her and it didn't work. I understand rehoming takes patience and understanding but my question I guess is... How long does the transition period normally last? She is showing no signs of slowing down. I am not rewarding her cries for attention with attention. I am rewarding her with scritches when she's quiet. I am not yelling or squirting with water.

Cinno1826,1575537307,e6eray,8,False,1,"I recently got a cat, i've had her for about a month now. She's roughly 7 months old, according to the Vet.  


For probably the first two weeks, she was sick with a bad upper respiratory infection so she didnt have a lot of energy, she would lay around a lot and have bad sneezing fits. A couple vet visits and two different antibiotics later, and she's now acting like a Kitten. Spazzy, playful and full of energy. But in this last week she's started playing in the litterbox, and its driving me absolutely crazy.  


She'll do her business, bury it, then leave the litter box to go play with her other toys, or nap, or eat or do other cat things. Then later, especially when she's playing with other toys, she'll run to the litter box and start digging in it and jumping around, or lay in it, or bury her paws, or all kinds of other weird things. I dont want her doing this for several reasons, the obvious one being that this is pretty gross and unsanitary, but as a secondary reason she's getting litter EVERYWHERE. She'll often jump out of the litterbox when she's done, or run out of it, and this flings litter all over the place.  


I dont know what to do to break her from this, and i've tried looking it up but apparently this doesnt seem like a very common problem. She's my first cat, and i'm very new to cat training in general so if anyone has any ideas or tips to get her to stop doing this, i'd appreciate it.  


Sidenote: I do scoop out her litterbox daily, since one of the antibiotics she was on gave her diarrhea. She's off those antibiotics now though and her poop has returned to normal, healthy consistency. Sometimes i'll miss a day of scooping but I always scoop it out the next day.

exghoulfriend,1575347611,e5bntu,16,False,1,"I have two kittens about 6.5mos old which I've had since they were 3mos. Obviously they have that same kitten energy but are now big enough to get into real trouble. They do all the regular naughty kitten things, but the one thing that's becoming really frustrating is that we cannot keep them off the bookshelf in our living room. It houses most of my partner's and my collectible/breakable stuff, of course üôÑ I've removed anything breakable from the main dangerzone, but the cats continue to get bigger and braver. 

I've tried tape. It works once, and then they start jumping up there just to play with it. I've tried the ""time out"" method. As soon as they get out of the time out room they go back to the shelf. I've tried moving them to the cat tree whenever they get on the shelf. They have two cat trees in the living area, one equal to and one taller than the height of the shelves they can get to. Both are near windows for them to look out, have good views of the rooms, and they regularly get treats on both. They have a ton of toys which I rotate, and get lots of playtime everyday. One of the cats mostly seems to just want to sit up there and chill, but the other wants to drag as much stuff off the shelves as she can. Nothing has broken yet but it's only a matter of time.

Obviously this is stressful for me, but it's really getting to my partner. He feels like he can't relax. He's at a point where he said he wants to get a spray bottle, which I've been against since the beginning. I told him that 1) he will only stress them out more and they will associate the punishment with him since they will still be able to get on the shelf while we're away. 2) I don't feel comfortable with him spraying the cats in the face with water, I think it's unacceptable. Plus, the cat that is the biggest concern loves water anyway. 3) No way in hell are you spraying water on my books and ruining them. I'd rather the cats sit on them. Ugh.

SgtPepper052667,1575216077,e4j6ms,3,False,1,"So our little girl Lily is a year and a half old or so and has been with us about a year. She‚Äôs been such a good, normal kitty since we adopted her. We provide her with furniture and toys that she is able to lay claim to.... well I could type at length how much I love her and how good she is so let me get down to the problem. 

My girlfriend and I are 22. We live with her mom ad a couple roommates. Lily hasn‚Äôt scratched up the carpet at all, until one day she wandered into my gf‚Äôs mom‚Äôs closet and accidentally got shut in for a few hours. I guess when she got stuck in there she figured she should try clawing at the carpet to get out. 

Before this incident, Lily had her own way of letting my gf and I know she wanted to come into our bedroom by sticking her paw under the door, which is a perfectly adorable and acceptable way to communicate that she wants to be let in. She always did this, and it worked great. 

I think that incident where she got trapped in the closet taught her two things:

1) If I scratch at the carpet, human will open door.
2) The carpet is scratch-able. 

Immediately after that incident, every time our door was closed, she would scratch at the carpet just outside our door along the wall to have us let her in, but I didn‚Äôt even notice this at first, because I was gaming with my headphones on playing online with my little brother (which is also why the door was closed) the first couple times it happened and that was enough time to do noticeable, semi-significant damage to the carpet in our apartment that the head lady was hoping to get her deposit back on. Anyway, no matter which way you slice it, this is a bad habit of Lily‚Äôs. 

Now some things to understand about the situation. Our bedroom is the room that we used to house warm Lily to, so it‚Äôs kind of like her special domain. It also houses the dual scratch post with the hammock on top that she sleeps in almost every night, in the room with us. 

We don‚Äôt always have the door closed, but often times we do, especially at night as we like to sleep naked. We live in Southern California, so it gets pretty hot especially in the summer so it‚Äôs practically almost not an option to not sleep naked when you‚Äôre both warm-blooded and love snuggling but can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre sweating bullets. We also close the door for sound reasons, so as to not disturb roommates while we‚Äôre playing video games or binging on Forensic Files. 

We do like a little privacy, so we like to close the door every once in a while. The thing that bothers me so much about this **_to no end_** is us and Lily had a system that worked GREAT right out of the box, and because of circumstances beyond our control she is now acting like a little punk. 

**What I want to know is whether there‚Äôs an effective method to training her so that she‚Äôll stick her paw under the door to signify to us she wants inside again. I keep hoping she‚Äôll just do it but she‚Äôs only done it like 2 times. Her go-to method is now to scratch. It‚Äôs also worth noting that she does not scratch at the carpet in any other context. Only when the door is closed and she wants in.**

We put a rug we had over the spot that she damaged so she can‚Äôt continue to ruin it. Every night if the door is closed she‚Äôll scratch at that rug just in front of the door. I really don‚Äôt want to let her in when she does this because that would be training her to do just that to get the door open. We bought a scratching pad on a rope to hang on the door knob but she never scratches that, always the rug. I get so irritated because I really want to welcome her into her room so she can be here hanging out with us and so she can sleep in her own bed, and also because this seems to happen whenever I‚Äôm trying to get to sleep, and the sound of her scratching at the rug for 5 minutes keeps me awake. Damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt. 

Halfway into writing this, she was scratching again. I did not let her in or give any indication to her I knew she was trying to get in. I waited it out and she stopped scratching and started meowing. After a couple meows I opened the door as soon as I could in hopes that would show her that‚Äôs an okay way to get in.",CatTraining,"Irritating Carpet Scratching Problem, Open To Advice"

Like he will straight up obliterate a shoe. I have to be super diligent that none are left out and I have to block the closet doors (sliding mirrors) because he quickly learned to open them and get inside.

TLDR: our one cat wont stop peeing in random areas at night, it‚Äôs effecting our sleep and our relationship and I‚Äôm pregnant. NEED HELP. 




My husband and I have three cats. 

Cats involved:

‚ÄúF‚Äù - 10 years old male, lived with husband for 9 years as an only kitty. Was gifted to husband as a newborn and was not neutered. Husband didn‚Äôt neuter him for 2-3 years. Does not get along with ‚ÄúO‚Äù now that we live together. 

‚ÄúO‚Äù - 4 years old male, lived with me for 1 year as an only kitty before V was adopted. Adopted neutered and all. A little bit of an alpha - bullies ‚ÄúF‚Äù. 

‚ÄúV‚Äù - 3 years old female, was never an only kitty. Adopted neutered/spayed. and all. Very good girl. Gets along with both ‚ÄúF‚Äù and ‚ÄúO‚Äù. 


So when my husband and I were newly dating, I use to stay over his house a lot. Every time I stayed over and left my overnight bag on the floor, ‚ÄúF‚Äù would pee on it (was about 4yo) at this time. Husband told me to keep my stuff on the floor and F wouldn‚Äôt pee on it. Worked fine but I always noticed his carpet smelled like old cat pee in certain areas. 

Fast forward a year or two, I have my own apartment and O and we‚Äôre moving closer to where husband and F live. There‚Äôs a delay in the apartment I‚Äôm renting and I can‚Äôt move in for another two weeks so I take O and myself to stay with husband and F. O is NOT happy. He‚Äôs an only child at this point so it took maybe a week of room separation/slow introduction for him to meet F. F and O got along fine by the time my apartment was ready. F wasn‚Äôt territorial and O was happy. 

Fast forward another year, I get V. I do the same room separation/slow introduction for V and O and it was great. Within 5 days they were cuddling. They‚Äôre best friends. No problems ever with liter boxes/behavior/aggression etc. 

One more year - V, O and I are moved into our new home and are waiting for for F and husband to move in with us when their lease is up. Move was hard for V, shes my sensitive girly. O was fine. They lived in the home for about a month before husband and F moved in. 

Day of move in - here‚Äôs where I think things get messy. Husband and I don‚Äôt separate F from O and V in his own room like we did in all precious kitty introductions because F and O (in our minds) already know each other and V is the chillest kitty in the world. F and O are okay for a few hours and then little fights start to break out - nothing crazy. Over time though things started to escalate. O wouldn‚Äôt let F anywhere he deemed ‚Äúhis‚Äù. Which was most places. F found some places that weren‚Äôt O‚Äôs - our bed in particular (which is V‚Äôs territory but she‚Äôs a good girl and doesn‚Äôt care who goes where), the top of our kitchen cabinets, and a spot on the couch by a window. I would say fights are limited to maybe once or twice a week but in general, dynamic is O is king of the castle and F avoids O whenever he can. 

I don‚Äôt remember exactly when it started but F started peeing around the house shortly after moving in. First it was stuff left on the floor - like V‚Äôs bed or if a throw blanket was touching the floor it was getting peed on. So we started managing things on the floor but now it‚Äôs gotten bad. He‚Äôs started peeing on random things throughout the night. Like the shower curtain, the couch, then it started to get really bad and he peed on the pillow my husband and I were sleeping on TWICE. Its almost every other night now and has been going on for months. It‚Äôs gotten so bad my husband and I barely sleep at night because every sound we jolt out of bed to try to stop him from peeing. It‚Äôs to the point where F can‚Äôt even come near the couch or the bed without husband or I are getting up to watch him - which isn‚Äôt fair to us or F ...since he does like to hang out and snuggle too. He‚Äôs not always peeing. It‚Äôs just put us edge. 

Now stuff is just stuff - I could probably manage and deal with it if it were shower curtains and pillow cases but I‚Äôm pregnant now. F has peed on all of our things and had peed directly next to our heads TWICE and I‚Äôm not sleeping as is. I think I may lose my mind if I see him pee on any of the baby‚Äôs stuff or even CLOSE to the baby. I have this fear I‚Äôll be up all night staring at him to keep him away from her things. 

Husband and I have been feeling very tense and have been short with each other. Sometimes he‚Äôs upset with F, sometimes he‚Äôs upset with me for leaving things around or ‚Äúallowing‚Äù O to bully F. For the record, I scold and swat away O anytime bullying happens. I can‚Äôt be a full time cat watcher. It‚Äôs effected our household and it‚Äôs causing so much unnecessary stress. 

I think we fucked up bringing F into the home without doing the separation/introduction as per usual. I‚Äôm to the point where I want to ask my husband to take F to his brothers until we can try again and give him his own space but I would never let husband separate me from O and V so it‚Äôs really not fair.....

She also eats separately from our other cat now, as she would shove him out of the way and scarf down his food as well if allowed to eat near him. 

With that being said, we are going to be gone for four days. I don‚Äôt want to hire a sitter to come twice a day every day for feedings because that seems silly for cats that would otherwise be fine left alone for that long. We would normally just leave a bunch of food out for them to eat while we are gone, but I‚Äôm positive we‚Äôll lose our progress with our chub of a cat if we do that. I thought about getting an automatic feeder, but I‚Äôm certain the food-obsesses lady would eat everything, starving the other guy. 

Is there anything we can do besides spending a bunch of money for someone to come feed them to prevent her from gaining weight back when we leave??",CatTraining,need to keep chonky cat from getting chonkier while out of town

Background:  
I am bonded to my cat who is a boy cat,7 years old. I also own 2 girls that are very sweet 6 year old and a 4 year old.  
Now with all of that in mind, I've never had any issues training my cats. All of them are equally loved and all of them are equally disciplined in a sense to know to keep off of things, to not be on certain surfaces, and know their basic commands. I've taught all of my cats on how to sit, stay, and high five. It took a lot of time but I want to say that they are good kitties and well this new cat is being trained fairly poorly.

I want to mention that I am expecting and I don't have the energy to begin training this kitten because solely this was my husbands responsibility. Thus the nightmare kitten is born.

We have stairs and the kitten likes to run in front of your feet and attack with full force at you. I tried telling husband that it may be cute but it's an accident that can happen. He doesn't correct the unwanted behavior and just scolds him in baby talk. Which is super ineffective. I tried telling him to tell him firmly ""NO!"" and not pet him or give him attention when he is being really naughty. 

The kitten shreds the toilet paper even though he has a TON of toys. He has destroyed cat teasers, cables, and chewed up wires. Again, husband doesn't correct the behavior and only rewards him with pets. He is quick to give excuses to me when I find out what the kitten did.

I told him that he is turning this cat into a monster. The kitten bites and attacks him and jumps on him. I'm telling him that those are terrible behaviors especially if we are having a baby. I explained to him that if I were to leave the baby with our older cats that I know they wouldn't hurt the baby. But if I were to leave the baby in the room with the kitten that the kitten would hurt the baby.

I told him that if this kitten ends up really hurting our baby, the kitten would need to be rehomed. It would be his fault if something happens.",CatTraining,Nightmare Cat

She's a great cat and I love her dearly, but I need some advice on how to get her to stop meowing and scratching at the door and trying to open it when my first alarm goes off (I take medication that doesn't allow me to eat for another hour, so it is not actually a wake up alarm). I've turned off the vibrate on my phone and lowered the volume as low as I can so that I still hear it and wake up. I think she can just sense movement in the bedroom. She knows the mechanism for how to open the door and has successfully gotten in a couple of times...it's actually pretty impressive. We know she's not hungry because we make sure to have food out overnight for her...we think she just simply misses us and wants our attention and because she hears the alarm she knows we're in the bedroom and she wants to play!

My husband is currently in his last year of med school and has tests to study for, so sleep is very essential to him. He's clearly getting increasingly frustrated with her constantly trying to bang down the door every morning. We definitely have tried different approaches to this - I suggested we ignore her. When we do, she will attempt the door on and off for every 15 mins or so, then go back to lying down, then she's back at it. He will get up and shoo her away from the door.

My family doesn't know the first thing about assimilating animals into our home, however, we were pet owners.(We had 2 separate yorkys who ,unfortunately,had left us too soon). I do most of the internet scouring to scavenge information about raising a cat and I am currently trying a method of giving it food after it interacts with me.

The cat itself is non aggressive. Not once have I heard the cat hiss or put itself in a defensive stance. It will hide from us for extended periods of time though. The cat will come out of hiding when I walk by or make itself know by meowing to me. At that point I'll stand or crouch with my hand out.

CannibalSupreme,1573429649,dujm2c,4,False,1,"SOOOO 

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 months ago, a stray had kittens on my wife and my's porch, then left them. We have been raising them. We already have 2 cats (a 10 year old, neutered male that my wife and I adopted together and a just-turned-2 year old neutered male that my wife received as a gift when he was 8 weeks). When we got our senior boy (Sea Bass), the then 1 year old (Chicken Nugget) had some issues adjusting to a new cat in the house although we introduced them properly. Just stuff like would pounce on Sea Bass, etc. playfully, but even though Sea Bass expressed that he was not interested (a hiss or upset meow and a bap, nothing aggressive), Nugget continued to bother him. Overtime, it did turn a little more aggressive (some claws here and there, no fighting though or anything crazy. Just like, Nugget tackles him, then runs off). We tried reintroducing them two or three times, but it didn't seem to help. Now that they've been together for a year, they'll sleep on the bed together and coexist and sometimes Nugget will antagonize him a little, but it doesn't seem to be territorial or anything. It's just Sea Bass strolls by, Nugget gets The Activated Look (ya know, airplane ears, big eyes, flicking tail, crouched kinda thing), goes in, then gets out. When we adopted Sea Bass, he was in the ""I'm very adoptable and friendly with other cats"" room with a bunch of other ""I'm very friendly and adoptable"" cats. Nugget I don't think had much, if any, cat socialization beyond when he was given to my wife. He is great with people, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

The kittens had their own Kitten Nursery in our house up until recently. There were many occasions during bottle feeding time when Nugget and Sea Bass would both come hang out, even once the kittens were on dry food there were short interactions. Neither had any issues with the kits beyond just normal ""please don't jump on my tail."" stuff (although Nugget became more grumpy as they got older), which the kittens have learned from and are very sweet and affectionate and don't bother either of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are planning to rehome 2 of the 4, but haven't had any luck thus far. Now that they are big enough to roam the house unsupervised with some kitten-proofing, they enjoy laying on the bed with Sea Bass, playing with each other and the toys around the house, and hanging out with us. Nugget is having some issues with them, though. He doesn't want them to approach him (will hiss and bap, no claws, if they do), but is also doing things like, if he passes one, he hisses and we have even caught him cornering one or two (there's a specific one he seems to have the most issue with, a female who is the most playful and rambunctious of the litter, but she hasn't tried to play with him or anything because she knows to avoid him). He doesn't growl, but my wife and I have heard so much hissing from him in the last few days, it's unreal. Sometimes he just hisses seemingly at air even if there aren't any kittens around him. We have a solid-sized house for the two of us, 4 litter boxes (I know it isn't enough for all of them, but we try to keep them clean, etc. The 2 we are rehoming will be going somewhere soon and we are going to get a 5th box soon as well), so everyone has plenty of places to hang out, nap, perch in windows (we have tons of windows), etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

None of this seems to be correlated with food, toys, attention, too much energy, etc. except for the last week when Nugget hisses at the kittens if they want to come inspect/play with a toy he is currently engaged with, but it's the same behavior regardless of the presence of a toy. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's the issue here? How do we fix it? What are we supposed to do in these situations in terms of behavior conditioning? If we see Nugget having an issue with a kitten, if the kitten doesn't leave before we get to it, we will remove one of them from the interaction.

So, we recently took in a 9 week old kitten that was abandoned for several days outside our apartment complex. He‚Äôs been with us for about three weeks now (he was 6 weeksish when we found him) and is doing great in terms of socialization with us. While he‚Äôs still nervous around new people, he is comfortable being pet, sometimes sleeps in our lap/next to us, cuddles in the bed, is extremely playful, and took to the litter box right away. 

The problem we‚Äôre having is him with our dog. She‚Äôs a very mellow yellow lab, really well trained (we do therapy work at hospitals and elementary school) and overall just a very good girl. She likes cats, but has never met a cat that would be very friendly with her. As a result, she won‚Äôt directly approach/chase cats and basically won‚Äôt initiate contact. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that she is not the problem. 

He always hisses at her if he‚Äôs in a corner somewhere and she walks too close to him. That‚Äôs understandable, she‚Äôs a big dog and we understand him Getting scared. But, recently when he‚Äôs been getting his night time zoomies while she‚Äôs fast asleep, he‚Äôll sometimes jump on her or in her face, scare himself, and then hiss at her, at which point she‚Äôll jump off the bed and go to another room.

He knows by now that she‚Äôs not going to hurt him. He walks by her just fine, is very interested in watching her from his cat tree or from under the sofa, and will play with us in the same vicinity as her. How do I best make it clear to him that hissing at her is not acceptable? 

I should also note that we agreed we would foster him for two months, get him all his shots and neutered, and then figure out what will happen.

I've had my cat for about 9 months, and he's really a sweet boy! He's about three years old, mellow in personality but very social. Unfortunately, he'll get into these periods where he will pee in my bed at least once a week. I took him into the vet when it first started happening back in the spring, and they said it wasn't a UTI and likely a stress reaction to my busy schedule. I'm a full time student and work a job that requires me to work late nights on occasion. On those nights where I'm working late, I have a sitter come to look after him and feed him dinner/play with him. But then sometimes he'll just react the next morning when I get up, even if I've fed him breakfast on time and cleaned the litter box. 

It's gotten to the point where I have to cover my bed with a plastic sheet every time I leave the house because I'm worried he'll make a mess again and I don't know what his trigger is.  I tried one of those Feliway sprays, and that didn't seem to have much effect. 

When in started in the spring, I thought it might also be a litter issue (he's very particular about his litterbox) so I switched his litter brand and that stopped it. But he's been on this one (TidyCats) for about six months and seems to like it. Some weeks, he'll have no issues, and then something will change that stresses him out and we're back to square one.

Cursethewind,1569682364,dagz7a,0,False,1,"I've worked with cats for my whole life and am really just posting this for additional ideas. 

Back in July, a cat showed up at my door when it was 110 heat index. She was pretty much at death's door. She had a tail pull injury, very likely a broken rear leg, and a severe UTI resulting from the tail pull. I brought her inside, and despite being unable to afford a vet, had a farmer friend of mine assist me with antibiotics and nursed her back to help. Her tail is slowly recovering, her leg appears to be fine, and her bladder and fecal control are at 99%. I still cannot afford a vet, $100 is even far out of my budget until about January, but feel this information is relevant. I do not believe she's spayed, but she has not had a heat since arriving at my door. She appears to be around 8 months old to a year.

My mom fell in love with this cat and moved her into her place when she moved upstairs. This cat is the sweetest thing with people. However, while she's great with people and will tolerate cats, she has a very strong pattern of territorial aggression. One of my mom's cats acts like prey, and quickly became a target. The cat became very stressed and my mom decided to move her back downstairs with me.

It's been about a week now and she has adjusted to a private room just she is in. I've been slowly introducing her with my two most tolerant cats for about five minutes at a time. There is no aggressive body language and she's doing well with the presence of both, yesterday contact was made and Little Man washed her face which was received appropriately. After that greeting, Little Man approached a cat post that the new cat has claimed and without even any body language, growling or hissing she launched herself at him in a full scale attack. He didn't attack back, appear nervous or anything, but backed from it. I ended the session.

I haven't seen guarding behavior of this scale from a cat. I'm planning to work with it by placing her and Little Man on leashes to keep him away from her post.

He's an extremely well behaved and independent kitten for the most part but he just will not stop thinking hands and feet are toys. The only time you can pet him is if he's tired and almost asleep, other than that as soon as you reach to pet him he'll immediately grab your hand with his paws (or all four if he's laying down) and give just enough claw to prick you while trying to bite you lightly. If he's laying down he'll do the rabbit kick thing with his hind legs while holding your hand with front paws and biting you. He's not doing this hard enough to draw blood or seriously hurt you it's like he thinks it's you're a toy.

Due to changing living constraints (downsizing) and the fact that Munchkin was the alpha and beat up on Panda frequently we decided to re-home Panda.  Munchkin was my wife's ""baby"" so it came down to keeping her and Moe. We've moved 4 times with him since 2012 and each time we move he gets worse.

Well, Munchkin passed away unexpectedly at age 6, about 2 years ago.  We were devastated.  Since then Moe's personality has progressively gotten more puzzling.  He won't sleep in our bed, unless the timing is right (never at night), and he's cold.  He can be very loving but will often bite my wife when she pets him on his cat tree.  Not hard enough to draw blood, but to signal that he's annoyed.   He is much less likely to bite me when I pet him on the tree, but when he's on the floor he's never bites and eats up the affection. He rolls around and asks for belly rubs even.   We concluded the tree seems to be his territory and he's asserting dominance.  Sometimes moving his tree will change the way he acts towards us.  When we had it in the bedroom he became aggressive and would bite far more frequently.  Moved it out and the aggression stopped.

Where is gets really strange is that he is becoming more and more afraid of inanimate objects, such as a shirt on the floor.  Basically anything that isn't statically in place.  It's like he's afraid a spider will jump out at him.  He low-creeps too it with his tail straight down, reaches his paw out very carefully to test/inspect it, and is incredibly jumpy as the slightest sound.  This happens daily.  He's terrified of items that are regularly tossed on the floor, and absolutely refuses to get on the bed UNLESS you remove all blankets and leave nothing but the fitted sheet on it.  In that case he's all over the bed and you can't keep him off it!  We can't think of any traumatic event that might have triggered this fear of blankets and clothing but he's 7 years old now and more difficult than ever to understand.  Our laundry detergent has been the same for many years, so it's not a scent issue as far as I know.  

He's also becoming more afraid of visitors, even people he knows.  Just the unexpected knock on the door and he's hiding under the bed facing the wall and not even his favorite treats will get him out.  He used to come straight back out into the living room and jump on their lap after someone walked in and he determined it was safe.   My wife is beginning to resent him because he wants nothing to do with her most of the time.  He sleeps in his cat tree pretty much all the time.  Aside from sleep and food, his primary obsession is with playing, specifically with me.  He constantly runs to his favorite toys when I am home.  He will interrupt me while gaming and walk me over to his favorite toys and give me the ""can we play?""  eyes, as well as the purring meow/mumble.   He needs me to actively engage with him or he's not interested in the toys.  I can't keep up with his drive to play constantly, and he doesn't engage with my wife nearly as much.  He seems to favor me more and more and I don't know why.  We don't know what to think.  We can't figure out why he's so scared and unaffectionate despite a safe, loving environment.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  My wife is really starting to take it personally and we are in no position to get him a friend again.",CatTraining,My cat is becoming more fearful of surroundings over the years?

The two kittens are incredibly, incredibly shy and scared of us. They‚Äôve been with us for just over a week, and are currently only allowed to be in the kitchen - this was decided to be the best room for them as we can lock the door and their food, litter, toys, cat tree, bed are all in there. 

If we enter the room, they both stop whatever they were doing and run to hide beneath the table. If we approach them to pick them up/pet them, they back away from us or run away.

We've kept two litter boxes in our kitchen and he used them happily for years since we adopted him when he was 6. The boxes are open topped and we'd not changed the type of box or little when for reasons we can't understand he decided he didn't want to go to the toilet in the boxes any more and instead wanted to go against the wall or on the wood floor, sometimes close to where the little boxes have always been and sometimes in the hall. 

At first we wondered if it might be an infection or some other health problem but he's since been to the vet three times and they can't find an obvious cause. They suggested that he might have had an unpleasant experience in the box, perhaps getting frightened whilst going to the toilet but weren't able to offer any good ideas for how to get him going there again. We've tried adding more boxes of various sizes and shapes in the other places in the house he was going, including lower sided boxes in case it was getting hard for him to get in and out as he's getting older but these don't seem to have made a difference.

She had said she was going to meet the new dog but I assumed meet really meant meet and it was just going to be a quick thing, and I didn't know when or any of the details. I guess my mom decided she liked the new dog because she paid for it and she is here to stay (my dad says we are technically fostering her and can give her back, but I know that won't happen. My parents like her and the dog has already been in several foster homes). Unfortunately, my mom didn't take any steps to try and introduce the new dog to our pets and just let the new dog settle in. Our two old dogs couldn't care less about her, but my cat very much does. My mom said that when the new dog first came in, she lunged at my cat and barked at him (apparently not in aggressive way but in a ""I want to be friends with you"" way) but either way, my cat bolted downstairs to our basement. My mom kept the new dog on a lead, but my cat tried to come upstairs a couple more times and each time the new dog tried to chase him and he ran again. At one point the new dog managed to get downstairs for a bit without my mom noticing. 

We have always had the stairs to our basement blocked with a baby gate so the dogs can't get down there. We don't really use the basement for anything but storage and to keep my cat's box there. He doesn't spend much time down there because he prefers to be in the living room/kitchen with us. So basically the basement has always been a cat-only space. There's an old bed down there, and he hid under it when we first adopted him (it took him a couple months to get used to us/the house) and where he is hiding now. 

Since he is hiding, we decided to make the basement his space away from the new dog. I've been reading online and everything says to introduce them slowly, give that cat its own space, make sure it can always escape, etc. I've been trying to do all the ""right"" things. We moved my cat's food and water downstairs for him, we are making sure the new dog can't get down to him, I go down a couple times every day to lure him out from under the bed and pet him and try to comfort him. At night, we've been keeping the new dog in my mom's room and my cat was coming upstairs for a couple hours. He was wary and checked everything out to make sure the new dog wasn't there, but he stopped hiding at night and then went back to the basement to hide during the day. 

After a week of keeping them totally separated but letting the get used to each other's smells (we gave the new dog a blanket my cat always sleeps on and obviously my cat smelled the dog when he was upstairs) we tried to let them look at each other. First I tried holding him to get a look at the new dog while she was on a leash but she jumped at him and he ran way to an elevated surface. We have another baby gate separating our living room from the hallway that leads to the rest of the house, so I put my cat behind the gate in the hallway and basically let him look at the new dog in living room. He was growling and hissing but didn't try to run or hide. She lost interest and basically wandered around--anytime he saw her again he growled. Eventually, I took him back to the basement and he hid under the bed again. 

Yesterday (the second day of trying to get them to see each other) I tried putting the new dog in the hallway and letting my cat look at her from the living room. I was hoping that it would make him feel more secure knowing that he had an exit to the basement. When my dad put him in front of the gate, he hissed and ran back to the basement to hide. That night, when the new dog was asleep and closed in the room, I tried to get him to come upstairs like he had been but he just ran back to the basement and hid.

Today (the third attempt), I put him back in the hallway with the new dog in the living room and he hissed and growled again, but eventually stopped and just watched her. She came to gate a few times but hasn't tried to chase/jump/bark at him again. Each time we've done this, I've sat next to my cat just in case, and pet him when he's not growling. While I was petting him, he at one point took his eyes off of her and looked at me--I don't know if that's an indication of progress or not. After about 10 minutes, I took him back downstairs (he growled at her again while I was holding him) and once I put him down he immediately hid under the bed. 

I know it hasn't been long and that it can take months, but I'm worried that he won't ever get used to her because their initial meeting went so poorly. I don't care if they ever actually like each other (he's never really liked the dogs--they ignore each other). I honestly just want him to get to the point where he isn't afraid and they can coexist peacefully. I never thought he would be this afraid because if anything, our dogs are scared of him. 

Am I doing the right things right now or should I try new methods? I want to keep him as comfortable as I can and make this as easy as possible for him, but I don't know what else to do and I can't stand the idea that he lives isolated in the basement for the rest of his life (taking him with me when I move out isn't an option--he is terrified being in the car and putting him in a new house with new people will stress him out even more). Does anybody have any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I have a 12 year old cat that used to live with my parents and I when I was growing up, so I've known her since she was a kitten. She still acts like a younger cat and still has several bad habits that my parents never stopped, one of which is jumping on the kitchen counters. When she lived with my parents it was a pretty stressful/toxic environment for her so when no one is around (or she thinks no one is around) she sometimes freaks out and does this specific ""meow"" to get attention. If she is able to get into the kitchen, she walks in and instantly jumps on the counters, not sure why. Perhaps being high up makes her feel safer? No matter how many times we try to get her to stop, she continues to do it. Her personality is extremely stubborn.

&amp;#x200B;

Things we've tried:

Those clapper things that make a loud noise - she figures out how to dodge them or jumps up anyway

SSSCAT - doesn't seem to work and/or she still jumps up. Plus honestly I don't feel comfortable with whatever it puts into the air (smells like chemicals)

Physically blocking her from coming in the kitchen - we have a door to a laundry room that blocks the entrance to the kitchen when open. If we put something heavy behind it, she can't get in. If we don't put something heavy, she just pushes the door to get in. While this is a temporary fix, it's extremely annoying because we live in a small condo and have to put a heavy object behind the door at all times, not to mention it's in front of the fridge so it basically just a hassle to get in/out of the kitchen.

Titan_Chu,1563312899,ce3f77,9,False,8,"A few days ago I posted about how I have a month old kitty and  what my family should do when I go away to college in August. I left out a lot, which made it seem like I don't give her attention or I keep her locked up in my room all day, so I understand the anger and I am sorry. So let me explain:

-I DO NOT keep her locked up in my room all day. I put her in my room when I leave and my grandma, uncle, dad will let her out. She's an inside kitty right now and I don't want her to run outside and get lost. The reason she is mainly kept in my room is because when I adopted her the shelter I got her from TOLD ME ""because of how small she is, keep her in 1 room at first, so she knows which is her room. Then you can introduce her to the rest of the house."" At least 4 times a day she will run around the house.

-Whenever I'm home, I play with her whenever I'm not sleeping. She has a variety of toys. She gets to run around a lot, as someone is usually always home.  I give her all of my attention whenever I can. There are just sometimes when I have to put her in my room. 

-The reason I got a kitty now was because all my life I was never allowed, but I've always wanted one. Both places I've lived in before we rented and pets weren't allowed. Every year I've lived with my grandma I ask her, and she always said no until this year. I know it's bad timing. 

I was genuinely asking for advice because I care about my kitty deeply. I understand that redditors were missing information but it breaks my heart that (I know you don't know me) anyone would think I would mistreat any animal.

I want them to get along and know it can be a long process but everything I have read says to put the dog in a muzzle and on lead to do intros once we get past the baby gate portion. My issue is--what keeps the cat from running up and swatting/attacking the dog? How do I go about handing the behavior portion for my cat?

Timeline:

Initially adopted a kitten and adult female cat together.  They got along well.

Rescued one adult male two years later.  One female ignored him, one (the younger one) didn't like him, but he didn't press the matter and they lived in harmony for about 6 years until he died. 

The two females lived with us for an additional 4 years until the older one died.  We still have the kitten who is now 13 years old.

I missed having a ""house full of cat love"" and got two more cats - another kitten/adult combo, this time male.  The adult male was neutered about 2-3 months ago.  

We knew they wouldn't necessarily get along right away.  We separated the two new cats into their own room.  The female shows zero interest in them.  No sniffing at the door, no going near their smell, etc.  The smell of them or the sight of them immediately leads to growling or hissing by the female.  

Currently situation is this:  the two males have their own room and are let out most of the day and in their room at night, the female has her own room and is in her room most of the day and allowed to wander as much as she wants at night (she doesn't like their smell, so she doesn't wander much).  

We just had a situation where the female refused to use a litter box that had the males' smell in it.  We didn't know she had this problem and ended up with a pile of poo on the floor.  She won't go near the closed door of her room due to their smell on the other side.  

We have read about site swapping, but are afraid the female would pretty much go catatonic on us.  I've shared the males' smell with her in the form of a blanket they've slept on - she hisses and growls at the blanket.  I've read the theory to share toys with the cats all in one room - that's not going to happen - she would probably gouge my eyes out if I brought them to the room where the males' hang out.  We tried to feed them on the opposite sides of a door about 10 feet apart.  The males ate, the female ran into another room rather than eating and really didn't want to be that close to them.  

We accidentally had an escape and a confrontation of the adult male to the female and ended up with growling/hissing, the male pinning the female behind a couch leaving several scratches on her, screaming, fur flying, and a puddle of urine (can't tell who it came from though - the male spraying or the female urinating from fear).  

It has only been two weeks and the situation has me stressed.  I know not all cats get along well, but this seems hopeless.  The adult male wants to get to the female and the female want nothing to do with either male to the point of fighting and at the same time utter fear.  The two males are getting along very well and make great companions for one another.  

The bad so far:

\- The males cannot sleep with us as they must stay in their room for the night.  This is not ideal.

\- Both cats have somewhat limited space.  Our house is a very open layout with an open staircase (no door) leading upstairs.  It is difficult to give the cats more than one room when they are separated and they are in the one room about half a day each.  

\- Two adults in the house who both work full time jobs.  We cannot stay home all day spending time with cats and frankly, don't want to spend all our free time 100% focused on the cats.  

\- Worried about the female who, even with all the ""how to introduce cats properly"" info we've read doesn't seem interested at all in participating in anything so long as the males are anywhere near her and the situation seems to be getting worse, not better.  She is scared to death all the time - very stressed.

We've grown fond of the adult male, and I'm totally in love with the male kitten.  My heart would absolutely break to give them back because the cats simply cannot get along.  But I'm thinking that may be the best thing for us at this point.  I guess I'm willing to wait it out if it takes 3-6 months, but my fear is that we get to next December and nothing changes and we are even more attached to the males.

The first time my older cat was introduced to another cat in the house it was not done properly and the two cats shared all their resources. My cat reacted negatively to that and would just hiss and growl. That all happened while I wasn't living in the house with the cat at the time. 

Now, I have read up a lot about cats and how to introduce them to each other. Most of what I've read says to keep them separated, but allow them to sniff the door and maybe even see each other through the door. So I've done that. Currently, my new cat has been in the house for two days and today was the first time either could sniff through the shared door. Pretty much every time my older cat goes next to the door, she sniffs a little and then hisses. It's quiet, and not really a distress call, sounds more annoyed than angry.

She has only ever done that to other animals. She's been in several houses with dogs and reacts the same when they are around for at least a month before she finally gets used to them. My main concern is that the first interaction that my older cat had with another cat was so negative and poorly handled that she just flat out won't get along with other cats. I know I'm probably just being impatient, but I'm just curious if anyone has had or heard of a similar situation and can give me some hope that they will eventually get along, even if it's months to years.

My roommate free feeds her dog, and he slowly eats throughout the day. I don't free feed my cat because she's on the verge of overweight and scarfs her food down when I feed her. She gets 1/4 cup of food in the morning and right before bed, but I catch her eating the dog food during the day, even immediately after eating her own food. I don't know how much of it she eats, but we put a second food bowl over the food when we go to work so she can't get to it. I'm worried about the dog food making her sick, so I'm wondering if there's any way to discourage her from eating it.

When I first got my cat, she *never* scratched the furniture. She occasionally scratched the carpet, but she much preferred a cardboard scratcher. I moved and got new furniture, and now she's scratching the couch. She scratched the carpet when we first moved, but now she just flexes her claws in it when she stretches. I think she's scratching the couch for attention, though, because she looks at me every time she does it. I've put the same cardboard scratcher next to the couch, and I trim her claws regularly, but she's still doing it and I'm starting to see signs of scratching. She won't touch any of the cardboard or carpet scratchers in the house, even though I've always encouraged her when she used them in the past. She just sits on top of the cardboard ones she used to love. Myself, my roommates, and all the guests we have give her lots of attention and playtime. What's the deal?

Hello fellow cat lovers! I‚Äôve been dying to get a wee guy for about two years now. My main hang up is that like most people, I‚Äôd like a little cuddly lapcat. I messaged someone who was selling four kittens when their cat got impregnated by the neighbour‚Äôs cat, but they were all gone except one by the time I got there. It‚Äôs stupid but I automatically started looking for reasons why no one wanted this little guy. I‚Äôm also unsure what qualities I should be looking for.

He was hiding under the table when we arrived, which I‚Äôm not sure is a good or bad thing. There is a dog in the house, 5 adult family members living there, and the mama cat is there, as well. The owner said the kitten loves the small dog in the house but is not particularly close to the mom now that she‚Äôs not producing milk.

I picked him up and he did not struggle, but became a bit squirmy after a few minutes and wanted to get away. Lots of photos of him climbing things from the owner, and I saw him chase after a wee piece of string on the table so he‚Äôs definitely a bit playful. He seemed a bit tired at a point as his eyes were closing, and when we put him down he scooted back under the table. My question is: is this a red flag? I don‚Äôt particularly want a timid cat, but he was hiding when we showed up and then scooted back under when we put him on the ground.

The owner claims he loves exploring and that all kittens will hide, but from my experience, many kittens will often approach you and want attention. Is he hiding because we‚Äôre strangers? She also said she found the wee man sleeping in her bed this morning. The kitten‚Äôs mom has a lovely temperament, although she does let you know when she‚Äôs had enough letting. The father is a bengal if that helps.

I‚Äôm genuinely just looking for feedback on whether this is normal kitten temperament, whether hiding instead of approaching strangers is indicative of a more timid cat, and if there is anything else I should be looking out for.

\*\*FYI: I will not be giving the cat away even if he does not become a lapcat. Just looking for some friendly advice on his behaviour!",CatTraining,Picking a kitten - hiding at breeders red flag?

We decided maybe getting another kitten would help, so we did and we got a cat that was exactly one month younger. We thought they would be perfect play mates- but the oldest kitten is really just a little shit. We‚Äôve had them for a while now and we keep them in separate rooms, alternating who is in and who is out.

finchbird,1560626721,c112wp,15,False,18,"Hey folks, I‚Äôve been dealing with a really gross situation for months and I think I just had a breakthrough!! Sorry in advance for the long post. 

A little backstory: we have two cats, a female who is about 5 (Onyxia) and a male who is turning 1 this week (Zaphod.) Before Zaphod, Onyxia was so mean! She would swipe at us and hide from us... for no apparent reason. She was sweet 70% of the time (rubs on your leg, meows for pets, head bumps, etc.) but then she would just turn on you and attack! I took her to the vet and she recommended that Onyxia was bored. We tried playing more and getting interactive feeders, all kinds of toys, taller cat trees with more platforms... nothing was helping. The vet suggested getting her a feline friend. 

Enter Zaphod. When we first got him we kept him in a large dog kennel while we were away, it had everything he needed except for room to run. This was necessary because of the limited space and the existing pets. We think he would scream all day because when we would get home he was hoarse, poor buddy. After he was old enough, we did away with the kennel. 

Onyxia‚Äôs pre-existing behavior issues evaporated overnight. She is super loving, never strikes out, never attacks us anymore. 

Onyxia then started peeing on the couches every once in a while. We‚Äôd clean it with enzyme cleaner and wash everything that might have been contaminated. 

We‚Äôve tried an array of solutions, including but not limited to: adding an additional cat box (3 in our 650sqft house,) changing to a cat litter with an attractant, changing foods, vet visits to rule out infection for both cats and our dog, hyper-cleaning our house on a regular basis with enzyme cleaners, using No More Marking, keeping thick plastic liners on our couches, spraying common spots with the marking spray before we leave or go to bed, more exercise, additional brushings, those plug-in pheromone things... Etc.

It‚Äôs been getting BAD recently. Onyxia has peed on something at least once a day for the last week and a half. I‚Äôve been at the end of my rope. 

I had to work from home yesterday and I noticed her sulking around the house, sniffing out her usual haunts for a place to go. I shooed her away two times before I got a little frustrated and picked her up. I carried her to the bathroom and closed the door before placing her in the cat box then turned away to give her a bit of privacy (she won‚Äôt go if you‚Äôre watching sometimes.) 

A few seconds went by and I didn‚Äôt hear anything so I turned around and she was full-squat, eyes closed... I laughed I was so happy. When she was done I gave her treats and pets and told her how good she was. 

I decided to do the same thing before going to bed hoping to save us from an incident in the middle of the night. As soon as she was in the box, Zaphod came HURDLING around the corner and immediately jumped on Onyxia! I clapped my hands and he darted off. Onxyia then got out of the cat box and tried to run away so I caught her and put her back in the box. She went potty and received treats and pets. 

I‚Äôve continued to take her to the three different boxes in the house every few hours and every time, Zaphod materializes to terrorize her. 

Since I‚Äôve started doing this, there have been no more incidents! 

I‚Äôm happy/annoyed. I think I found the root of the problem? Maybe? I suppose it could be that Zaphod doesn‚Äôt like to share the box... but there isn‚Äôt a way to have a designated box for either cat.

I'm about to move into a house at the same time as another couple, and we both have cats. The cats haven't met, and also neither one has been to the new house yet.

They're both adult males- mine is getting up in years while the other is only a couple years old. Mine has always been in a multi-cat household, but as far as we know, the other one has only lived with dogs.

I assume the basics about keeping them separated are the same, but should we avoid letting one get familiar with the whole house before we bring the second one in? Is it better to let each get used to part of the house before introducing them, or will that increase the likelihood of one or both getting territorial? Should we try to introduce the two in their current homes BEFORE we move?? All of this is at least a month away, so we have time to plan ahead.

My vet has no suggestions that I haven't already tried, just wants me to keep bringing him there for the trims.

Is there anything else I can try?

Is it safer for him, being FIV positive, to go to the vet to get trimmed or to bring him to claw trimming clinics? At the vet sick pets go, but at a clinic he might be exposed to fleas or untreated animals.

Is this a case where declawing might be a valid option since his claws do bother him? They get stuck in things, he accidentally claws us and there are a few claws that risk growing into his pad on a regular basis. (I'm well aware of the concerns around declawing, but in a case where his claws risk getting ingrown or him getting sick from frequent trips to the vet I've been considering it.)",CatTraining,Shelter cat refuses to let me trim his claws
TheFeralBookworm,1558683085,bsdyvn,5,False,6,"So first off, I live in New Zealand, and most cats here are indoor/outdoor. I am also a vet nurse at a busy emergency clinic, so I frequently see cats and kittens that have been hit by cars. I know how deadly and/or expensive it can be. That being said, I recently adopted an 11wk kitten, and want her to have outdoor access during the day. 

She's my first kitten - all my previous cats have been road-sensible adults - and I really want to do everything I can to minimise the chance of a road accident for her.

Steps I've already taken include planning to keep her inside after dark, making sure she's microchipped with up to date details, and buying her the most reflective collar I could find, with a tag listing her details. We're working on coming when called, but it's spotty at the mo. She's also already desexed, as she's from the SPCA. And I have savings in case she needs medical care.

Problem is a lot of that is reactive, and won't help much if she just runs into the road without thinking.

daffbb,1557590845,bndp4h,5,False,8,"I ‚Äúadopted‚Äù Peanut when he was estimated to be around 5 years old. At that point, he had already been in 4 different homes. That was three years ago.

He‚Äôs my BABY. I love him so much. He is so cuddly and sweet and affectionate and has so much personality. And when I got him I made a commitment to us both that it would be me and him till the end.

He is, unfortunately, extremely play aggressive. When he‚Äôs bored or amped up, he will attack anything that moves, and hard. He draws blood almost every time.

- cat shelves for increased vertical space
- cat puzzles
- No Bowl feeding system

- calming treats
- calming catnip
- CBD oil
- CBD treats
- feliway spray and diffusers

- putting him in time out when he attacks
- going limp and ignoring him when he attacks
- leaving the room when he attacks
- spray bottles

I leave my cat at home most of the time, but if my family isn't home I take my cat with me when I have work to get done instead of leaving her home alone.

My cat Lana recently started having issues with what we believe was constipation. She was pooping on the floor and vet recommended we try giving her some wet food to combat the possible constipation issue. Began giving her some a few days ago in supplement to dry food, and immediately she started popping in the litter box again.

The reason we are still using dry food is because my OTHER cat ozzie cannot eat wet food. If he does, he immediately regurgitates it without fail every time. Ozzie regurgitates dry food too, but not as often. He at least retains some of it. (before anyone asks.... yes he has been to the vet for diagnostics multiple times, at different vets, and they never find anything wrong. Hes somehow in perfectly good health).

In a perfect world I could just get them both on a feeding schedule where lana eats her wet food and ozzie eats his dry food, separate from each other, but I dont know if I can. I've tried getting Ozzie on a schedule in the past, but he would regurgitate his food even more frequently, I think because he would eat too much too quickly, being very hungry. And yes... I've tried absolutely everything that exists to get him to eat slower. And I mean everything. Been dealing with this issue for 10+ years.

So what I've been doing is leaving a little dry food out, but giving lana small amounts (like a spoonful or two) of wet food once or twice a day as well, in a separate room from ozzie. It's hard to get her to eat it sometimes though. She acts like she wants it then once I give it to her she doesnt care about it. I have to put some on my hands, and HAND feed her before she will actually start eating from the dish. And sometimes, not even that works. Sometimes she just refuses and would rather play or something. So I have to put her food away, put away the dry food AS WELL so she cant eat that, in hope she will hungry enough later to eat the wet food.

But I really dont like having to temporarily starve my cats, especially ozzie, who kinda gets punished for her unwillingness to eat. But if I leave out dry food for him, Lana might eat that and still not want any wet food later.

I‚Äôm here for any tips or advice on things that are best reinforced early. In the past I‚Äôve owned dogs, and I never really used negative reinforcement - more just positively reinforcing good behavior and trying to prevent poor manners or destructive behavior before they started. I assume the same would apply for cats! Some things I‚Äôm worried about include - 

- scratching (I know it‚Äôs instinctive and kitty will not be declawed of course, so wondering if we will have to encourage her to use the posts we‚Äôve gotten instead of furniture or if that will come naturally?) Also, my aunt had a cat that constantly scratched guests (even if we were just sitting there). Is this behavior related to early socialization, as might be the case with dogs? If not, is there anything I can do to make kitty more comfortable with strangers in the house?

- Nail clipping - I read you should get your cat accustomed with handling their paws/claws for when they need to be clipped. I will also ask at her first vet visit, but how often did you guys do this if you even did? I‚Äôm just trying to crowd source how best to handle that so as not to make if a negative experience. 


- Cat carrier/ walking on lead - the agency we are adopting from has told us that her mom (who was surrendered due to a move) actually walks on a leash, so it‚Äôs possible kitty would be amenable to it as well. While we aren‚Äôt sure that we‚Äôd use it to walk her (we live in a city and are worried it‚Äôd just be too stimulating) we thought if we exposed her to it, it might be an easier and less traumatic way to travel with her when needed. My boyfriends old cat HATED the carrier - as I have read many do. If not the lead, any tips on how to make a carrier more of a safe space and less a scary one? 

- also - what toys would you recommend for a cat who might spend a few hours a day alone during the week?


I feel like I‚Äôve already requested a lot of information lol! I have already looked into a lot of these issues online, but am wondering what successes you guys have had re: raising a kitten. Really any tips and advice even if u related to above would be SO APPRECIATED.

rocketshipjesus,1554394556,b9es00,8,False,1,"Hi there. My SO and I rescued a stray outside of our house from the cold in January. We have two almost 10 year old boy indoor cats. One is a tabby, one is a big all black cat. The new cat is about 9 months old at this point. While she's adorable, she is a bit of a terror. She bullies our oldest and smaller cat (won't let him use the litterbox without attacking) and they keep scratching each other's faces up. She leaves the black cat alone mostly (we think she's scared of him). It's taken about 2.5 months for them to all coexist together, but she's still not able to spend the night in an open house.   


The problem is she has a bad habit of scratching/biting/attacking us and the other cats. We are concerned she will hurt our older tabby seriously if we leave them alone. But we're eventually going to have to go out of town this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what we've tried:

\- scheduled play times with a wand toy

\- leaving the room when she bites

\- separating her from the other cats when she attacks (is this the right thing to do?)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what our setup is like:

\- 2 litterboxes and 2 feeding stations at opposite ends of the house

\- They are all able to eat together at the same time without fighting

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, we're wondering if she would be better off as an only child? I really want to fix her problematic behavior because we're attached to her and I'm worried if we have to rehome other people won't be as patient.

Anyway um a couple things have happen over the course of the time we have had her that have given me a concern which I don't really know why or how to handle them. I'd say maybe the 3rd or 4th day we had her, she was using the litterbox fine, everything was great. One night my gf was at work, I was home I was paying attention to her and she ended up shitting in the corner of our living room, I cleaned it up (we have her food out at all times currently), I put her food up after words. Then maybe a hour later she was crying again for food, gave her some  then she ran to another corner of the room and shit. This time I was watching her the whole time, yelled at her while she did it. Googled online and saw one of the reasons could of been her not having enough litter, Added more litter and after that everything was fine, she used the litterbox like she used too like normal. Anyway my problem today is, one her shit smells actually so awful, it smells the whole apt, I understand shit smells but I have never smelled something so disgusting come from something so small. I'm wondering if changing her food would help with the smell, her shit almost looks diarrhea like but not really if that makes sense.

Cats are two years old and sisters. They‚Äôve never shown any real aggression since I adopted them 1.5 years ago.

The change to their territory came pretty quickly: all of a sudden there were new people and furniture in a previously empty space so I‚Äôm sure that was very stressful for them. Also there is an older dog that is currently secluded in a bedroom. Eventually the dog will be allowed downstairs and the upstairs will be cats only.

Curiously when I seclude them in my bedroom together they do fine and started snuggling almost immediately.

My ideas are:
-get some calming pheromones for them
-let them out one at a time to explore and get their scent in the new area

First of all I am not quite sure being in the right subreddit. If I am not, please show me the way!

I have adopted a 7 months old cat (tiger-like European race) one month ago. He is a very gentle and cuddle-needy cat.

However, rapidly, as he became more used to his new home, he has started biting me a lot (hand, arm, ankle, feet, head). I think he is playing, but he is growing more and more violent with his biting. He doesn't bite anything else but humans. Yesterday I tried to let him bite my hand without reacting at all. As my hand became his new toy, he went on a biting and scratching frenzy and I had to stop him eventually (he was really hurting me). 

I have tried several things to teach him not to bite: tossing water, calling a time-out, verbally scolding him, ignoring him. Nothing seemed to really work. Currently, I feel a bit helpless as I don't know what is the proper way of teaching a cat and as his behavior deteriorates. 

Thus me seeking help in this sub! What do you think guys? Here are some additional informations. 

Food: at first, I was feeding him a lot. As he gained some weight rapidly (skinny to normal), I reduced the amount of food that he is provided (now 1 cup of croquette). Nonetheless, he still has an urge to eat. For instance, he often tries to eat in my plate (whatever the food, he is interested). 

Fleas: when I received him, he had fleas. I treated him as I treated my house. He seems to be fine now.

Play time: I play with him daily (stuffed animals, laser). He also has a cat tree at his disposal. 

Training: I have started toilet training him, with mild success.

Librarycat77,1552200113,azd40m,2,False,11,"Backstory: Torri is a 13 year old spayed domestic medium haired cat. We've had her since she was about 4 weeks old (she was abandoned and brought to my work), and shes the first kitten I ever raised. As such, she was very much a test case.

Between her being kitten no.1 and our older female being a jerk Torri developed some bad habits and personality issues.

I've worked with her before, but there's definitely some bumps I'd like to iron out.

Goals:
* grooming
* confidence
* bonding

Despite me being the 'pet person' and the one who does all the feeding and care, Torri is very much my SOs cat. She'll sleep with me and cuddle in bed, but pretty much anything else she'd rather do with her daddy. So, I'd like to do something fun with her.

Shes always been a shy kitty, and has improved leaps and bounds over the years (she will now let a small number of our friends pet her as many as 4 times before shes done...), I'd still like to see her be more confident. We have 4 cats and Torri doesnt get along with the others. Years ago we set her up with her own room (our bedroom) so she'd have a safe space to de-stress.

She spends quite a bit of time there (She has her own litter, scratcher, water, gets her meals there, and is the only kitty who gets access to my heated blanket - shes not suffering. It's a Princess Tower.), by her own choice, and she has been playing in the main part of our house when our two boys are put away eating dinner, but I'd like to integrate her even more. I'll be happy with anything even remotely like success there. She'd be thrilled to be an only kitty, so just not being mad at our other cats existing would be a positive.

Grooming. This is the big bad. I have made steps forward here and there, but trimming her nails is awful. I'm working specifically on cooperative care techniques, as I've had great luck with my older girl and it's what I believe in.

Me: I've worked training dogs for over 10 years, although I'm not training much now. I foster kittens and mums for a local rescue, but our foster room is hosting a friend atm, so I've got spare time to dedicate to Torri. I do kitty behavior consults sometimes. Basically, I do know what I'm doing, but Torri's personality (flighty, nervous, very cautious, etc) makes her a slow learner and I know I get impatient with her - which makes it worse.

My goal for myself is patience with her, and to do something small daily. I'm going to try keeping a public diary for accountability, tracking how far we've come (which is easier when you've written down exactly where you started - trainer pro tip), and maybe inspiring some others to join me.

Cats are trainable, but it is different than working with dogs.

Day 1: reintroducing clicker training, desensitization to grooming tools.

Torri knows what a clicker and touch- stick are (chopstick with the end colored black, not fancy) so I just did a 5 minute session to figure out which treats she likes best, have her be around me and the grooming tools (tools on the floor, me ignoring them), and seeing if she remembers the clicker.

She definitely remembers the clicker and touch stick - she started touching the stick as soon as I set it down. The clicker may be too loud, she was flinching from the noise. I may try a click-pen and see if she prefers that noise.

We started easy, just touching the stick and clicking. Then left, right, up and down. Step forward was harder, but she did do it. I think she was hesitant because of stepping towards the tools on the ground.

I introduced two new objects, craft puff balls and got her to touch both, although she was very hesitant and only would do one each. I think it was the clicker noise throwing her off at this point.

She did a touch on the scissors! Very big deal, we did a jackpot.

Then her attention was clearly waning (5 minutes) and I did one last easy touch, gave her an ending jackpot, and put the treats away.

I did leave the clicker, stick, and tools out. I sprinkled her favorite treats around, and then left so I wasn't pressuring her. She ate them as soon as I was more than 5 feet away. Good news.

I'll try to post once a week to track weekly progress.

My partner and I adopted a male kitten at 7 weeks back in May. He's almost 10 months old now, neutered, and seemingly has sexual aggression towards my adult (5 years) female cat. 

Anytime my poor female cat even moves, he goes up behind her, mounts her, and bites her neck. She understandably screams, hisses, and tries her best to get away. Sometimes the male will chase her to try again, sometimes he will give up that round. 

After some research and ruling out that it's sexual aggression, I purchased the Hog Mate boar spray that has been mentioned and recommended many times in articles. The first time I sprayed in on the female's rear, the male definitely seemed confused and backed off the entire evening.

In the almost 6 years we've all lived together, she's attacked my partner probably 5 or 6 times. Only once was when I was home and could discipline her. She has bitten his thumb (very deep), she has scratched at/gotten his face, and I think once she scratched his hand. Chosen form of discipline was either spray bottle or solitary confinement in the bathroom for 10 minutes or so. The rest of the time she and my partner have a very good relationship and I would say that she loves him (always on his lap, purs on him in the morning, sleeps near him, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

So, my partner is understandably upset - she just attacked him again and almost got his eye. He was cleaning our other cat's butt when she attacked - I'm guessing it was some kind of protective thing on her end. He says I need to control my cat.

maidenmandalore,1549465325,anrj25,2,False,1,"ATTN: cat whisperers and animals friends and psychologists alike, I need some help 

I have a cat, Tycho, who is a four year old male and has lived with two male cats in the past. He was a kitten and grew up around them. He loved to cuddle them, and play and all was well. Roommate moved out, so did her cats and Tycho was lonely. He cried often, he was dying for attention and it broke my heart. 

In August, I moved into a new home (Tycho's first new home since I took him in from the shelter at three months old), with a new roommate and his cat as well. Maddie is about the same age but she is female. Maddie is very timid, and Tycho is one hell of a busy-body. Both cats are fixed and all that jazz. As we expected there was a lot of hissing, batting, and fighting (or hiding if you're Maddie) initially. This dwindled after a couple months, we were able to leave all the doors open and let the cats roam free with no conflicts. 

Things have been going well, they nap within close proximity of each other. We got a cat tree that Maddie can perch on to scope out the whole place to give her a sense of security. They're even started playing, willingly. I'll see Maddie go after Tycho in playful manner, which is incredible considering she only used to want to hiss and hide. They are quiet towards each other, no stressed vocalizations, hissing. Just the occasional thump of cat paws speeding through the house when they're playing. We've had a perfect three months or so of peace. 


Suddenly in the last month Tycho has begun persistently eating Maddie's food. We redirect him to his own, which he has always enjoyed and ate without problem (and his dish is usually still full since he keeps munching on Maddie's.) Because of this, Maddie is always hungry and begging for food when my roommate comes home from work. 

Tycho has also begun pooping outside of his litterbox, directly in front of it, even when his box is near glistening clean. I've resorted to cleaning it every day vs. every other day as I have. Even if he pees once in his box it seems he won't use it again, until I scoop it. It also appears he has stopped burying his stuff in litter when he's done, which is odd cause he's always been a ""litterbox digger."" He's never had accidents before (except when I went on a vacation and left him behind), he's always been great about using his box. I try keeping it the cleanest but he'll still go on the floor right outside his box maybe a few times a week. I'm not sure if it's territorial, since they have been acclimated for a while and Tycho hasn't gone anywhere else in the house. 

I am stressing out and tired of feeling rage towards my cat that I love so much. Anybody have any input, ideas or training ideas I could use to help steer my cat away from eating the others food and figure out how to entice him to use his box?

zandrazandala,1549389030,angn5h,3,False,1,"TL;DR: Fixed the cat and he calmed down but everything still scares him, now he's having random outbursts where he really attacks us during normal events. 

We have had him since he was a kitten and he's my sister's cat. I was told to leave him alone to bond with her (because I ""steal"" animals by loving them). He was not stimulated and his hygiene was non existent because that's my sister... I'm concerned that this has effected his mental health. 

Recently our whole living situation has changed and the cat has had to live with me away from my sister since July. He was not fixed then and had already attacked me twice (I assume from lack of stimulation and he knew I played with him, just not multiple bites to the leg level that he was at). 

The first few months were rough, we have two other cats and we kept him in a room full of my sister's items and slowly let him get comfortable and have a space designated. He likes the other cats, but maybe just to bully because I can feel the difference in his playing when it's one or the other. Ether way he attacked feet at night and started stalking my husband and I, especially my husband (recently my husband, I basically moved in when the cat did). After that he started full blown attacks, once majorly for me with multiple bites and deep punctures while wrapping himself around my leg. This happen when I went to walk towards my stepfather, I can write that one off although the scars will stay for awhile. 

We were worried for awhile as the attacks kept happening and we excused it by providing more stimulation since it was an adjustment for us all. Finally we realized it got worse with my period and had him fixed. Slowly he relaxed into a happy house cat and his aggressions became more manageable and we could see that the more recent outbursts have happened out of unreasonable fear. Like he will play with his paws some in a gentle way with us which was something he earned back, but occasionally he will snap and attack. He had always been easy to scare and jumpy at the world which I can understand in a cat but this seems like some thing more.

Recently he's been fantastic. He's slept in the bed all night through me kicking him, he's napping in my husband's spot when he leaves for work and cuddles, he has his morning hair grooming with my husband after getting out of the shower, even sits on the counter as he gets ready in the morning and let's him love on him. Well this leads me to my point, this morning's hair grooming turned into 4 tooth punctures in his cheek and lacerations on his hands bad enough to have to gauze and wrap his hands before he left for work.

I think it's an attempt at dominance but we want him to feel like he can love on us by grooming but maybe that's the mistake? My husband, while having to be one that punishes him often also loves and plays with him all the time and it's killing him that he has to be mean and assert dominance after the cat does these things. But I don't know any other way than to speak his language. He's smart as hell but jumps at the smallest things every time, I wonder occasionally if his perception is distorted or if he was abused before we got him as a kitten. Our response this morning was to grab him and hold him in place by the back of his neck, spray him with water and put him in time out (isolate him in another room). During the day today I'm going to try and keep him from my husband's spot on the bed but there is no trigger to the outbursts and he's been with us for 7 months.

A month ago, we moved into an apartment together, and got some couches and chairs. We followed many online cat trainers' advice for getting him to stop scratching: put carpet tape on the furniture and if we see him scratching, pick him up and move him to the nearest scratching post. 

That worked at first.. but now he thinks it's a game. He doesn't scratch the couches at ALL when we aren't there, but when he feels like he's being ignored he'll start clawing the couches on a spot without tape, waiting for a reaction. When he gets one (such as looking over or standing up to grab him), he'll dart under the couch so you have to grab him. 

Methods I've tried:
- Picking him up and tossing him so he knows I'm not playing a game (not effective)
- Giving him a time out in a closet or the bathroom (not effective, he just has fun in there instead)
- Playing with him to get his energy out (works to tire him out, but I also don't want to positively reinforce the behavior further)

mani_mani,1547061016,aea5dt,2,False,1,"My kitten, Buns, is a little over 6 months old. I fostered him before I adopted him so I have had him since he was 2 months old, save a week when he went back to the shelter to get neutered. He stayed with his litter mates until he was 4 months old. He was separated from his mother (she died) soon after birth. I began socializing him and his litter mates from day one. I always played with them using toys, never hands or feet. He played well with his litter mates, though he could annoy them with continuous play.

Buns can be a wonderful cat. He is genuinely affectionate and very smart. My issue is that he has continued to have play aggression that has gotten increasingly worse, I am also concerned that it is starting to become plain old aggression as well.

Behavior:

* Attacks feet when walking by
* Attack arms and hands while petting
* Jumps on people's backs
* Will attack people who are just sitting on the couch
* Will continue to try to play/attack while panting from exhaustion

What have I tried:

* 15 min of vigorous play twice a day
* Leash training
* Throwing toys while being attacked to divert attention
* Not moving while being attacked to make it not fun
* Installing a cat tree
* Playing videos for cats on tv
* Rotating toys
* Automatic laser pointer
* Leave out boxes and brown bags for him to play with

I am at my wits end with him. I understand he is a kitten, I have always had cats and kittens in my house, but I have never had one as high energy as him.

Over the holidays I brought him with me to my parent's place since I was going to be gone for a long period of time. He didn't have nearly as many behavioral issues then. Difference is my parents live in the suburbs in a large home and I live in NYC in a 1 bedroom apartment. They also have a high energy kitten that Buns played well with (after they were properly introduced and separated of course). Though I will say even with the kitten she found him annoying after awhile and we had to break them up before the playing turned into fighting.

My question is what else can I do to help my cat get all of this pent up energy out? It's gotten to the point I can't sit on my own couch with out being bitten. I'm concerned because he has started to bite when I clip his nails, something he has never done before. I've been handling his paws since he was 2 months old. How can I create a space in my 1 bedroom that is stimulating enough for him so I don't have to be a source of constant entertainment.

My roommate has a cat who keeps pooping on his bed. We thought he (the cat) was upset due to the litter box issue, we only had one, but that has been fixed. We are getting fustrated since he is chosing to pee on our clothes now. He prefers to poop on clean clothes even if his boxes are clean.

 He has peed on the carpet multiple time aswell .Any ideas on what I can do. This is starting to hit our finances hard due to the amount of cleaning(stuff to remove urine scents &amp; cleaners) we have to constantly do. 

Few details
-We have 3 cats and 3 jumbo litter boxes
-The litter box is scooped every day
- he is fixed
- we have taken him to vet and no issues have been found 
- other cats are one Male (5years old,fixed) and one female (6 months, not fixed)

tilyd,1546549260,aca64v,4,False,1,"Hi!
I'm looking for a new food bowl for my cat. She tends to eat quickly and regurgitate. I've used them for around 2 years now, I think my cat is pretty good at it but I haven't found the perfect bowl yet.

Here are the ones I tried so far with the pros and cons :

Aikiou Stimulo : 
Pros : Different difficulty levels, can contain a lot of food.
Cons : Big, discontinued :(
I loved this one, but lost some of the tubes while moving and it was way too easy without them... I'd buy another one but they don't make them anymore.

Catit Food Tree
Pros : A bit higher difficulty, stable.
Cons : Huge, I have a tiny appartment and it took a lot of space. Also the small kibbles got stuck in the little corners and my cat had a hard time getting them out. Kind of a pain in the ass to clean.

BeOneBreed Intellikat
Pros : Many many different possibilities of levels. Small!
Cons : Way too light and easy to push over, it moves around a lot. When my cat tries to get kibble out of the harder levels, she pushes the bowl towards her and it doesn't work very well.

I'm basically looking for a bowl thats stable and not too big, but can contain around 1 cup of food.

I'm considering maybe these bowls; Catch by northmate, Aikiou ThinCat, Catit digger.

Anyone ever tried some of those that think they would be a good fit?

Sometimes even noises from the street make her go into military crawl mode for a few seconds. 

Her anxiety when we aren't home can be quite bad. One time I took her with me to my studio overnight (yay pulling all-nighters to meet deadlines) and she refused to eat, drink water or use the litter box until we went back home in the morning. She'd been there before for short periods of time, and since I'd seen her exploring and sniffing things I thought she'd be fine, but apparently I was wrong. 

Being on my lap (sometimes with her face in my armpit) helps curb her anxiety when we are in a foreign place. That's where she's usually at when we are at my studio, and she's fallen asleep on me a few times when visiting one of my friends (sometimes I go to her house to binge watch shows and I bring my cat along in hopes of helping her get used to new spaces). 

The reason I want to bring her with me is that my only other option would be to leave her at the vet's hotel (no pet sitting service where I live, and none of my friends are in town those days), and last year when I picked her up from there she looked so depressed and broken down that it broke my heart. They took good care of her, but she felt left behind. 

I'm not sure how healthy it is for her, but she's my baby: she kneads me at least once a day (and has done so everyday since she moved in, a bit over a year ago), sleeps on the same pillow as me, and her favorite day of the week is Sunday because she gets to spend all day long with me. She's napping next to me as I type this. The only time I've spent the night away without her (other than last year's holidays) she waited for me all night by the window even though she was taking some anti-anxiety natural drops the vet recommended. 

Now, my question is what the best way to go about taking her with me in a trip would be. I've read about feliway, and they've been pushy at the vet's office about that product, but as far as I know it wouldn't help make her more relaxed around strangers, and I've read online that it's not always effective and that some cats react adversely to it, so I want to know your opinion about it. Another option would be asking the vet for stronger anti-anxiety medication than the naturist drops he gave me last time. 

All advice is welcome, I just want this trip to go as smoothly as possible for all parties involved. ",CatTraining,Taking my anxious cat on a trip for the holidays - help!

I have two adult male cats, both neutered, who have been buddies since 2014. One of them, Shilo, had dental surgery on Nov. 5. When I brought him home, the other cat, Marlee, acted aggressively toward him because he smelled like the vet. We kept them apart and did scent transfers with a towel during this time. A week after the procedure, Shilo is feeling better, but he's frightened of Marlee. Whenever they make eye contact (especially if they're on the floor), Shilo will growl and hiss, and Marlee responds by fighting him. At which point, Shilo runs under a bed and Marlee corners him there. We've broken up a few squabbles with a squirt gun and blanket. They'll occasionally tolerate each other in the same room, even the rare cuddle, but that's usually short-lasting.

We fitted them with Sentry calming collars, did more scent transfers, reinforced friendly behavior with treats, and kept them separated at night. Is there anything else we should do differently or add? Should we treat them like we're introducing brand new cats?

frazaga962,1541893728,9vz4so,13,False,1,"Hi all, 

Was just wondering if there was any extra advice for a kitten that seems keen on attacking exposed skin? I've looked through the subreddit and have tried various methods but I'm not sure if the kitten understands that biting skin is painful/redirecting the ""aggression"" to an animal is a result of our pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Different methods we've tried:  
1- While cuddling, if kitten starts biting, we stop cuddling immediately and put him on the floor. Usually this results in him attacking our feet, ankles, and calves.  
2- If he doesn't stop this we start to hiss at him. In the first few weeks of having him we were doing ""Tssssst"" and ""OWWW"" but he didn't seem to get it, so I've started to really hiss. He stops briefly, but will be back within a minute.  
3- Tried giving him a stuffed animal larger than him and he enjoys tackling it and biting it but a- we sometimes can't get to it in time before he gets a few nips at our skin and b- he quickly loses interest in it when it is not moving.  
4- Have tried distracting him with other toys to tire him out (laser pointer and feather string) but again, not sure if he gets the fact that biting us is painful.  
5- Method of last resort- after a couple of hisses, put him in a time out in a closed room with the stuffed animal. Only issue is, unless the animal is moving, he's not keen to hunt it. He comes out of the time out very sad/subdued that he was left alone but again, not really teaching him that biting is painful.

atchoummmm,1541734193,9vh07m,2,False,1,"I have 4 adults cats who have lived together for the past 11 years. I adopted one pair of sisters when they were 5 months old, and the other two were foster failures who arrived at 4 weeks old when the first two were about 8 months old, and never left.

Everyone used to get along just fine for the first couple of years, but when the younger two reached puberty, things started to become more complicated. The main troublemaker is the younger female, Blackie, who is very bossy and cheeky (and strong). Besides attacking one of the older ones (Beetle), she likes to randomly smack the other cats when they are too close to her for her liking, and also when they are coming back from the  vet's. She seems to think that any familiar-looking cat that smells different from the vet's is a body snatcher, and whenever that happens she freaks out and hisses at/smacks everyone for two or three days, time for the smell to wear off.

Bettle is also bossy and rather grumpy. She loves her sister, tolerates the younger male, but hisses every time Blackie comes near her or is staring at her looking for trouble.

The weird thing is, they seem to  be doing just fine 90% of the time, especially when humans are busy doing something else. But as soon as human attention is to be had, no matter how much I try to share it equally, give each of them special alone time and playtime, etc., Blackie still gets a kick out of attacking Beetle. If she sees her playing by herself, minding her own business and having fun, she will take any chance she gets to ambush her and pounce on her. If she is bored and feeling feisty, she will go pester Beetle while she is sleeping. In return, Beetle will smack her every time she can, and will hiss preemptively whenever she is near.

After years of trying to police these two and reading Cat vs Cat, I want to give clicker training a chance. I know I should first set up the positive association with the clicker with treats (I have done that with dogs before), and then mark positive behaviors (like sharing space peacefully, breaking a stare, walking by without being aggressive, etc.), but was hoping to hear if anyone has a similar situation that were able to improve?

SidHat,1540991877,9symxe,9,False,1,"Hi folks, I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to litter train a cat (kitten)? The vet recently informed my wife she is 4-4.5 months old. 

We have two dogs and were not necessarily looking to add more pets, but one particularly cold night a couple of weeks ago Sophie showed up on our porch and made it very clear she was needing help (food, water, heat, all of the above?). She meowed and climbed all over my wife as we fed her some dog food which she eagerly ate. We also gave her water. 

Of course the dogs complicated bringing her inside so we gave her a box of towels on the porch but also left the garage door open. She slept somewhere in the garage that night. 

The next day we brought her in. We still only had dog food to give her, and we put some sawdust in a low cardboard box for her litter. 

She and the dogs were still adjusting so for the time we barricaded her in the kitchen with food and the makeshift litter box. She used it. 

We went out later that day to buy real cat food and a litter box. We set up that litter box and she used both the makeshift and regular litter box when set up in the kitchen. 

We never intended to keep a litter box in the kitchen though, so after a few days when the dogs had adjusted we removed the barricade and moved the regular litter box to the basement where we intended to keep it. 

She will not use it. She has been relieving herself (probably #1, definitely #2) in a small storm runoff trough against the wall in the basement. We‚Äôve moved the litter box up against that wall and she still won‚Äôt use it.

The dog will steer clear from the cat and the cat will watch from his tree for a while, but without fail the cat will eventually get on the ground to attack the dog again (the dog will start barking back once the cat begins hissing and coming towards him, but not before that). He has cut up the dog a few times, as well as sliced up my boyfriend's arm and leg trying to get to the dog.

I came to inherit the dog rather suddenly after a failed foster was going to turn him over to a high kill shelter. I kept the cat separated in my room and the dog in the living room with baby gates for awhile. 

But my boyfriend‚Äôs cat allergy got worse when she was confined to my room whenever he would come over. My roommate moved out so she got her own room with the empty spare room. She was not happy. She fought at the gate and head butted it until I finally let her out.

Before 3 months ago I had never owned a cat. I found myself adopting this 7 year old girl named Bell.
I love her and adore her so much. At first I wanted to keep her as a house cat, but realised that this would be both impossible to train and also unfair as she was previously not a house cat. 
Ever since day one of being outside, it's all she wants to do. She will sit in the garden and on occasion go over the fencing which through the day I really don't mind. We don't have a cat flap so we have to leave the back door open for her at all times so she can come and go as she pleases. 
It's starting to get dark at nights and we need to start having her in earlier, especially as it's getting colder too. However she just won't let up
I call her in for dinner at 8pm and within half an hour she's sat at the back door meowing. If I don't give her attention she will start scratching at the door and knocking the keys for my attention. If I continue to refuse to pay attention she will sit at the windows and climb the blinds and has come close to breaking them.
I can't sit and watch a movie. I can't stand in the kitchen. I can't be anywhere near the back end of my house without her meowing. My boyfriend has a very very short temper and I asked him to bare with me at the start while I attempted to train her. He has previously owned a cat but none of his advise has made any impact.

She has scratching posts and toys in the house and she loves a cuddle but she just won't ever do any of that at any point right until bed time. Bed time is the only time she will settle

Well, they happened to pick this scrappy little black thing and he's really quite a people person. And by that I mean he'll get up in your business. The guy across the street from my coworker said that if they didn't find a way to keep the cat off his property, he'd call animal control or kill it. They couldn't keep kitty inside because of their allergies, so they had to rehome him.

So my coworker asked me if I'd take kitty, as I'd been thinking about getting a cat.

BradBradMaddoxMaddox,1534525020,983y9e,2,False,2,"Hey everyone, my girlfriend and I adopted two kittens and have had them for a week. Everything has been great but I just have a couple of questions.

1. I want to do clicker training and I've been reading up on it a lot. However, the clicker is way louder than I thought, and I imagine even if I get a quiet one, it wouldn't solve the problem of both cats hearing the clicker no matter who I'm clicking for. I live in a one-bedroom apartment and if, lets say, I want to click and drop a treat for one cat for doing something good, will the other cat assume it, too, is doing something good even if its on the other side of the room? Basically, how do I train two kittens when its not feasible to separate them in different rooms? 

2. Is there something else I can give to a kitten who seemingly doesn't care for treats? One of my kittens loves when I drop a treat in front of him but the other completely ignores it. I've tried three different brands/flavors so far and no luck. 

3. This isn't necessarily related to training but I imagine some of you would have an answer for me. My two kittens are brothers and they wrestle a lot. I know its play because they go back and forth and have no problem with eachother as soon as they stop. However, one of the kittens is ALWAYS the loser. They're both 9 weeks old but Kitten A always manages to pin down Kitten B and Kitten A starts meowing in pain. Normally B would stop, adjust position, then go for the attack again, and Kitten A would again meow in pain. A couple of times when Kitten A would meow, I would walk over and say something to get their attention, they'd look at me, then continue playing. I don't think Kitten B is doing this to be mean, either, because a lot of times after Kitten A meows, B would then play the ""prey"" and fall over and let A attack him, but A just isn't that aggressive and even when he goes for the attack on top, B manages to beat him. Do I just let this continue or should I try to stop or separate them when A is meowing too much? It's never to the point where A is hissing or where they avoid each other but this morning, B wouldn't let A go and after A finally escaped he hid in a corner for a minute before licking himself and coming back out like everything was fine.

4. Last question, and its another one that isn't training related: does anyone have any links to toys or games that run automatically without a human being there? As soon as I come home, I can throw some toys around and they get super active, they chase after toys, they run around, they wrestle each other, but it seems like they need some kind of prompt. When I'm at work, I have a petcam set up and they do nothing all day. They saunter around, they sleep, and that's basically it. I feel like if there was something that would spark their interest, they'd be more active. I have Cat TV playing but it doesn't seem to entice them. I know there are a lot of electronic cat toys but all the ones I saw require someone to be there to turn them on and turn them off.

Now, he's young enough and docile enough that we're not concerned about him attacking either of our cats, and since they've never had much experience with dogs either, we don't think they'll have problems with him. That being said, we want them to have a safe space they can hang out in that he can't get to.

eukomos,1533923018,9694eu,4,False,2,"My roommate's cat has a slightly odd behavior pattern and I'd appreciate other people's thoughts on it. So, main thing is, as it says in the title, he pees on my bed. Generally I try to keep the door to my bedroom closed but I don't always remember and it's not a fantastic solution for us, and he's still upset about something, so I'm trying to figure out what's wrong and fix it.

It's clearly linked to separation anxiety with her, the first time it happened she'd been on vacation for a week and it flairs up again whenever she's on vacation. He's a big momma's boy, and nervous around strangers. When I first moved in he'd snuggle with me while she was gone but he won't anymore, and I'm not sure how to comfort him. He does sometimes do it while she's home, though, so I can't just keep my door closed while she's traveling and not worry about it the rest of the time, which I'd be ok with.

I also suspect some amount of territorial issues? Between all of us roommates we have four cats stuffed into one house, and keeping the peace can be a little tough. My cat is a very large, rambunctious kitten, and can beat up on the others sometimes both intentionally and while trying to play. I exercise my cat but I can never totally tire him out for more than a few minutes. Oddly, the guy who's peeing on my bed is the one who gets along best with my cat, though. And it's not spraying, he's squatting and peeing, so that might lower the odds of it being territorial? When I changed the litter of the litter box in my room to the same kind my roommate uses and added another one in the living room he got better about the peeing on my bed, but it didn't totally go away.

But it's also only on the bed, towards the head of the bed which is under a window, so maybe that means it's a territorial impulse towards what's outside? We get raccoons in the backyard, which the window looks out onto, but not strange cats.

She was only 8-12 weeks old. We thought, ""pfft!"" (having owned cats before) and brought her home. We named her Liz.

Liz has never reliably pooped in the box. Most of the time she'll poop right *next* to the box. At first we thought, ok she's one of these cats that needs 2 boxes, one for pooping and one for peeing. We setup 3 boxes but there was no change in behavior.

We also thought it might be the litter type. We've switched from unscented crystals to fine crystals (supposedly less sharp on their paws). This also did not change behavior.

She has a lot of anxiety when she needs to poop. If we see her starting to zoom around or sniff around one of the boxes we can sometimes talk her through it (""good girl! In the box! Good girl!"") or sometimes she'll start and we'll lift her in the box mid-poop, and we'll praise her for finishing in the right spot. She doesn't seem to be getting better thought.

mkikuti,1533228459,940xzy,8,False,5,"Hi everyone. I'm hoping someone here can give me some useful advice on this. My cat is 8 years old, she lived most of her life indoors only, with rare travels in her cage. Still, she is very sociable to other people and some animals. I recently moved to another country (US), and as always she did great on her travel, I thought her how to use a leash and she even walked around the airport, no problem. We move a lot, so she is definitely used to the moving. The first month here went great, she didn't complaint at all, so since we have a nice quiet place with a lot a green nearby I decided it would be great if I could walk her outside every other day so she could enjoy the grass and the sun. The problem is she enjoyed it so much she now won't stop meowing and scratching the door to go outside, even during the night time when everyone is trying to sleep. I would just ignore it, but I'm afraid the neighbors might complain soon as we live in an apartment and she is very loud.

I tried ignoring it when she is meowing during the day, tried scaring her throwing something soft when she does it, tried to lock her away in a separate room until she quiets down, so far nothing worked. I tried taking her out again and it made it even worse when she got back at the apartment. We are afraid taking her outside when she is behaving like that may be a reenforcement to that behavior. We are now considering not letting her out at all so she will hopefully forget about it, but I really like walking with her and it would be a shame if we couldn't do that anymore.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. She is castrated, she is not in pain, very healthy and loved being around us. And sorry for any English mistakes.",CatTraining,Cat won't stop meowing and scratching the door

2. She has not taken to the litter box. She has peed in our bed twice and pooped in her ‚Äúbed‚Äù (just a cardboard box with a blanket in it) once. It is still her first day, so we can‚Äôt blame her too much, but still, any litter-training suggestions would be appreciated.

I've found since then my roommate doesn't really care to train the cat whatsoever (and is practically never home). She scratches everything (including the common room things that are mine) and my roommate does nothing whatsoever to curb this behavior. Not only this, but the kitten is a menace.

OfficialMaxBox,1531808508,8ziqyj,10,False,4,"I've basically started walking with a water spritzer bottle whenever I walk anywhere in the house, it's the only real way I can think of that possibly might help.

The cat's pretty nice, but according to my friend, the cat didn't get any training as he grew up, plus didn't have a mom (which apparently is a pretty important thing with cat-manners?).

I work from home, so I'm basically with the cat at all times. Most of the things he does are pretty negligible: comes into my room, meows for attention, and when I turn to give him some scratches (or even acknowledge he's there), most of the time he'll just make his way out of the room, only to repeat the process anywhere from 5-10 times. If I try to ignore him, as to avoid giving him reinforcement, he'll just circle my chair before either jumping onto the desk or my leg/arm (with claws extended).

To combat that, I've tried keeping my door closed, but that just leads to consistent cries and door-scratches. I've tried following the ""ignore, and make some noise to show the cat you're not going to pay attention to him"", but after about two weeks, that's not taught him. 

Anywhere from 4am-8am, he'll scratch and meow at my bedroom door for attention, which obviously isn't fun. I left the door cracked three times; two times he just hopped onto the bed and woke me up softly, but one time when I was trying to give him a little attention, he full wrapped around my raised arm, claws digging in, while biting full-force into my wrist.

While walking, he'll CONSTANTLY try to get in front of my legs (making a ~3 second hallway walk up to 10 seconds). I don't feel remotely secure trying to walk through him, but aside from holding his scruff while walking, I can't figure out a way to keep him out of my way. Occasionally, he'll also wrap around my leg (with claws and biting, like before), one time even full on tripping me.

So CatTraining, I beg you, what can I do? As annoying as he is, I don't want to spray him with water whenever he does anything, but it's truly come to the point where I don't leave my room without the spritzer. He's ~5 years old, if that matters.

   I am currently going through a situation with my cat and dog. When I moved away for school, about 7 months ago, I rescued a 6 year old cat in a different city. My dog who is a 2 year old German Shepherd will be living with me at my new apartment (where my cat resides) for a week. He has never interacted with a cat before, and usually when he sees strays, he barks and tries to chase them. 

   Last night was his first night here. The cat was locked in a room with her necessities. After vigorously exercising him, I decided to let them meet. So I held my dog by the collar and brought him into the room. Initially, he did not even notice her, but he noticed her litter, as he was more intrigued by her poop (he's icky like that) and cat food in her bowl. It was only when I pointed her out he noticed her. I watched his body language, he was surprisingly not at all hostile, his tail was wagging and he slowly began moving towards her as he continuously sniffed. Their noses even touched as they both were sniffing each other out. Through out this, my cat was staring straight into his eyes and she constantly hissed at home. When their noses touched, she smacked him causing him to bark and run out of the door. 

   I tried this exercise with both of them multiple times last night and today, my dog remains very calm while she hisses and stares at home. Occasionally, their gazes will fix, and this where I noticed my dog getting a bit hostile towards her. I have even left him in the room with her, while I sit beside her petting her, and it is only when she hisses, he even notices her and wants to come close to her. Usually, he is just more interested in the smell of the room (as it is my roommates) or her food. He has even laid down underneath the bed she was sitting on, not even bothering her. However, as I continue to introduce them, I notice that my dog's hostility is slightly increasing towards her when she hisses at him. He went from being so careful and gently, to barking at her.

Over the past 2 weeks our cat has become increasingly aggressive towards everyone, human or animal. We live in an area highly populated with cats, all house pets. I have been unable to pick up my cat as I could a few months ago, I can't pet her, all because she hisses and swipes at me. We have seen neighbors physically have to chase off our cat due to her attacking other cats. Not people, I feel that's important to mention. 

Prior to this, my cat is spoiled. Toys, got them for entertainment by the bucket-load. A nice cat tower for sleeping, she cuddles me and my partner when shes in the mood and we never deny her. She is argumentative and will not stop meowing when she doesn't get her way, you give out and she ""Argues"" back, we have been unable to train her to stop jumping on counters and is very swift with claws.

Over the past 24 hours, I have been able to see some of her outdoor behavior first hand, and unfortunately have a scab to remind me. Around 10PM last night there was no sign of my cat. She has gone missing before but turned out she got locked in a vacant house next door for 3 days. When out looking for her, I found her sitting in a tree, maybe stuck. Upon finding her, I noticed there were 4 other cats sitting around the tree, not directly, like across the road. I offered my shoulder for her to jump down on, offered her the arm to walk down on, no movement. I attempted to lift her down as she seemed stuck, and she took a swipe and caught my hand, hissed and growled at me.  


After that, she jumped out of the tree, and then attacked another cat who was a good 20 meters away, jumped under a car and I couldn't get her. I wasn't prepared to put my hand on her again for obvious, painful reasons... We got her in in the end, but this type of behavior cannot continue.

She is VERY food driven and is completely relentless when it comes down to food. We scold her and a friend suggested spraying her with a spray bottle. She runs away,  but immediately comes back for more.  Like I said before, I‚Äôve only ever had dogs and I‚Äôve heard that what works for dogs does not work for cats. 

I‚Äôm worried that if we cannot get these behaviors under control, we will have to rehome her, which I really don‚Äôt want to do. We have a baby on the way (due Sept) and I would hate to have her climbing all over stuff she‚Äôs not supposed to. 

Any help is GREATLY appreciated:) ",CatTraining,FIRST TIME CAT OWNER! Help!

This has not been an issue up until about a month ago but has gotten progressively worse this past week. Normally she starts digging around 6am and keeps digging until my husband goes in there and kicks her out of the litter box and out of our room all together. Since her litter box is in our master bath, it has been waking us up every morning. 

We don't like keeping her from her litter box but we don't really know the reason why she is doing this. We are thinking it may be to get some attention in the morning? If we moved the box to a different location where she can dig to her heart's content, do you think she will eventually stop if it is attention based?",CatTraining,Cat keeps digging in litter box.

aforementionedapples,1528769307,8qf7h1,13,False,7,"My fiancee and I got an 8 month old male Russian Blue a few months ago to give our 2 year old female Russian Blue a companion. He will meow incessantly as soon as he hears the food jar open and will steal the other cat's food once he's done with his. He sits at the side of the table, silently begging for our food when we are eating. I even caught him taking pizza off my plate when I wasn't looking! 

I read that using a verbal cue like ""Good!"" instead of a clicker can work to train cats not to be so excited when it's feeding time and, to an extent, it's worked, but he's not nearly where we want him to be. We feed him 1/4 cup of dry food twice a day about 12 hours apart with the occasional wet food. Here's how we've been training him thus far...

First, I give the 2 year old her meal in another room since she's always so quiet and docile, even at feeding time. The male follows so I have to hold him while I put her bowl down. 

Next, I take him to a secluded area and stand right in front him with his bowl between us and about 1/4 of his dry food in my hand. I look right at him and run a 20 second timer in my head. I'm looking for three things: sitting, a quiet mouth, and some eye contact.  If he can do that for 20 seconds, I say ""Good!"" and drop what I have in my hand into his bowl. If he meows while I'm counting to 20 or if he shoots his butt up or meows after I say ""Good!"", I reset the timer. Rinse and repeat until his food is gone. It takes about 15-20 minutes to feed him total.

I try playing with him to wear him out before feeding, but he just lays down after a couple minutes of using a laser pointer or one of his wand toys and hopes that the action will come to him. So, I just stop the playing altogether since it feels like he's trying to train me instead!

Is there anything we should be doing differently? Any advice would be appreciated!",CatTraining,"My cat is food obsessed. Been trying to train him not to be so excited for food, but nothing has really worked so far. Am I doing something wrong?"

We brought her home and brought her to the vet. She was so small, the vet couldn't determine her sex as well weigh her on the scale. 

Over the next few months we noticed that she never peed or pooped in her litter box. We have been trying to train her for the last few years and she still won't use it.

My male cat who is around 16/17 years old is becoming more and more aggressive towards my GF.  He is a maincoone who I have had since he was a kitten or so. He has always been kind of an asshole though. He has cornered my old GF at one time and a roommate. He has scratched or tried many times through the years but as of late it's getting worse. 


We recently moved back in January and I feel this kind of took a toll on the old boy as he seems a lot older now with the way he walks around and such. We took him to the vet and they said he seemed fine other than what happens when you move a cat and such into a new home. Without blood work they can't tell anything else.


Anyways tonight my GF was playing cat sounds on her phone as she does from time to time and he went to sniff her, then bite her hand a bit. She quickly moved her hand away and he attacked her full arm without even making a noise. I picked him up and put him in his bed but he tried getting up and getting over to her again so i put in the bathroom for a bit in the dark. She is pretty shaken up as he tends to be mean to her.


I thought it might be arthritis so i have him on some fish oils and things to help his joints. I even tried some CDB oilds and that seemed to mellow him out till tonight.


Any thoughts? Help? I would hate to think what would happen if he attacked a kid or one of our friends.

chemicataclysmic,1527923317,8nyyf9,5,False,1,"My cat adores attention and I give her as much as humanly possible. But there are some times (when I'm working, for example,) where she wants attention or to play and I just can't give in to her.
That's when she acts in a way she *knows* gets reactions and I don't know what to do.

These things are scratching the couch (she has scratched through the couch to the point where the foam on the inside is coming out, we don't care about this couch too much but we want to break this habit for the future,) which I try to pick her up and gently move her to appropriate scratching posts whenever I catch her doing it. She knows this, and will scratch the couch *just to get me to get up or to react to her.* As soon as I move towards her, she runs off. If I go back to working, she comes back and does it again.

The other thing is nipping at my ankles, hands, basically any skin close to her. She doesn't break the skin (and even if she did I'm immune to cat scratch fever at this point.) I mainly try to ignore this because I don't want her thinking that it gets me to play with her. But biting fucking hurts and I'll jerk away or say ""Ow!"" Without meaning to, or try to shoo her away. This is usually combined with the scratching, when she runs away from the couch, she'll come back, scratch, stare at me with eyes dilated, tail whipping, and ears back, and then jump on me and bite.

She's not trying to hurt me, I know she's just trying to get my attention so we can play. I don't do this anymore, but if I stop what I'm doing and get her wand toy, she immediately stops this behavior. If I give her an independent toy I know she likes to play with on her own, about 50% of the time it would work, and the other 50 she'll just ignore it and keep pestering me.

As cat fearing people, we took him in and after awhile he was really nice with the other two, older female cats. We got him fixed and he calmed down. The past few weeks, however, he's gotten much worse and he's developed many bad behaviors, such as tipping the water and food bowls which is starting to ruin the tile, scratching furniture, dragging dirty clothes everywhere, etc. 

He's also been stressing out the other two cats, as they seem as though they're always on edge, hiding during the day or when he's awake, and running away from him when he starts messing with them.

jae_bea,1527299068,8m6vrx,4,False,3,"I have a spayed 9 month old female and I live in an apartment complex where our walkway leads right to a parking lot.  A few weeks ago she started strolling out the front door with my bi like she owns the place.  We decided that we wanted to let her go outside on a leash, in the hopes it would reduce the chance of her walking out and getting lost, or reduce the urge to go explore.  Last week, we started taking her out on her harness once a day when I got home from work.  She LOVES it.  And she's stopped trying to walk out the front door!  However, she now spends the next several hours after her walk meowing and yowling at the front door to go back out.  We walk her around our building and on the grasses until she walks us back to the apartment, so I don't think the walks are too short, and as she gets comfortable with the area/follows commands better we'll extend the walks.  Our area isn't safe to let her roam by herself \- we face a parking lot in a busy complex surrounded by farms.  So we have cars, outside cats, lots of people, and wild turkeys, foxes, and hawks, and she weighs five pounds and has never been outside until these walks.  We absolutely cannot let her out alone.

For the past week, we've been ignoring her when she meows, hoping that with time it would stop.  It has not.  She has now gone from meowing at the door, to meowing at the door and the windows, to now standing on our shoulders and meowing in our ears while we pretend to it isn't happening.  Our neighbors can hear her through the walls and we feel like crazy people.  Today, I caved and got a spray bottle.  She caught on after a few sprays and is now hiding in the curtains where I can't get her, meowing at the top of her lungs out the window by the door, and stopping the moment she hears me get up, only to start again when I sit back down.

I don't want to take the walks away from her because she loves it, but the meowing is incessant and needs to stop for everyone's sake.  Should I keep with the spraying?  Go back to ignoring her?  Stop the walks?  How long can this process take?  We're also leaving for a 7 day trip in a week and will have friends stopping in every day for her, which I know is going to throw her off.  I'll most likely have to restart the process then, but I want to start it now.  This very tired cat mama is is in need of advice.",CatTraining,Cat meowing constantly to go out after walks
chemicataclysmic,1527129971,8lpb2b,7,False,5,"I live in a 1200sqf apartment. I have one adopted barn cat, 2.5 years old, who has been indoors all her life- save for a couple times moving house. We have plenty of toys and spaces for her to climb/hide (she is more of a hiding cat than a climbing one, she likes to pop out from in tubes and behind doors to hunt.) She usually loves strangers that come into our house and demands attention and treats from them, with no period of fear or hiding when a new person shows up.

However, I don't think she's getting enough exercise. She frequently gets frustrated and attacks me for attention/to play with her (she'll scratch things, point her ears back/dilated eyes, and jump on me and ""play fight"" when she wants to play or is bored.) We have 15-20 minutes of interactive play every day, but we're usually gone all day so I understand that she gets bored. Because of this, I figured it would be good for her to go on daily walks in the afternoon before dinner. (She gets fed at 7 and 7 with timed feeders.)

I got her an H harness and a leash that fits her last week. She tolerates the harness well, and doesn't mind the leash either- as long as we're in the house. She's very smart and has taken off any collar we've tried to put on her, and at one point we got her a comfy cat sweater for her food anxiety but she manages to wriggle out of it after an hour of wearing it (we don't put it on her anymore since her anxiety was related to the other cat in the house.) But I only leave the H harness on for about an hour or so and it doesn't seem to cause her discomfort or movement issues so she doesn't try to wriggle out.

Anyway, when I was first training her, I thought she was tolerating the harness and leash so well, and she's a naturally curious and extroverted cat, so I let her out into the hallway of our apartment complex. This was a HUGE mistake, I know now. She was very curious and excited to explore at first, but quickly got very anxious and tried to hide in corners and run away. Since the door to our apartment was closed, I ended up having to follow her to the opposite side of the complex in order not to tug on the leash too hard. Then, after I picked her up to go home, someone came into the door nearby and she FREAKED. When we finally got back into the house (10 minutes after leaving) she was so anxious she hid under the table and had to cuddle with me for an hour.

Ever since, I've been trying to get her used to just being in the apartment with the door open. A couple days after our first experiment, I put the harness on her and sat against the door to keep it open, and fed her lots of treats by leading her from the apartment to the hallway with the treat in my hand, and gently tossing the treats into the hallway. She ran out to get them and came back, and i thought this was amazing progress. Unfortunately I seem to have the worst luck when it comes to my neighbors, and despite this being 9 o'clock on Monday night, people were walking around in the hallways and going in and out of the apartment. As soon as this started, she ran and hid under the table. This whole thing lasted about 15 minutes. Once I closed the door she ran to me and cuddled me for about half an hour, then fell asleep, despite being full of energy before the experiment.

Tuesday I tried to do the same thing at around 6 when she was in a playful mood, but she refused to go outside the apartment and I had to lead her with treats just to get near the door while it was open. I tried using a laser pointer to get her to play near the door, but she wasn't interested. Only one person walked by, which made her hide and only come back for one treat. She only tolerated about 10 minutes and then wriggled out of her harness (I was holding the leash) and hid in the opposite side of the apartment. Once I closed the door she came to me for cuddles.

Today is Wednesday and I tried to do the same thing today around 9pm, and she was able to be led to the door with treats at first, but refused to step outside the door into the corridor. Again, people started coming in and she tried to run away. I was holding the leash, figuring that even if she was scared there were places to hide within the 6ft leash length, and I could at least train her to get used to staying within 6ft of me. She did in fact hide in the places nearby (behind a laundry basket, a suitcase, under my desk,) and I gave her treats by hand while she was nearby, occasionally leading her closer to me to give her the treat but not towards the hallway.

After the third person walked by she bolted, wriggled out of the harness, and hid on the other side of the apartment. I figured she felt unsafe with the door open so decided to sit in front of the open hallway with her treats and see if she would approach on her own. After 10 minutes of hiding, she came back and ""checked"" on me, staying out of sight of the hallway. I gave her a treat, and she ran off again. Ten minutes later, she came back again (in sight of the hallway,) got another treat, and then ran under the table where she could see me and the hallway. She stayed there for about a minute and then ran back to the other side of the apartment.

And that's where we are now. She hasn't come back to check on me and I've been sitting in front of the hallway the whole time I've been writing this post (about 20 minutes,) occasionally calling her with my ""come let me pet you"" sound. I haven't closed the door yet, I'm sitting here like an idiot having my neighbors stare at me because my apartment door's wide open and I'm just sitting here.

I NEED HELP. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, I feel like the more I do to slowly introduce her to the hallway, to lessen her anxiety, (I've been pulling back treat requirements for each experiment, giving her more treats for smaller actions like moving closer to me) the more anxious she gets. I know it might take a few months to train her which is fine, but there's no guide out there on how to train them to go outside, everyone just says ""get them used to the harness and then go outside and let them lead you!!"" Yeah well I tried that and my cat is terrified of strangers and the hallway. I don't know how to convince her that no one outside is going to hurt her and it can be fun to go outside! I can't even get her to the backyard (my goal, she loves watching the birds out there) because she won't go into the hallway to GET outside!!!

basically 3 weeks ago I got a new kitten (4 months old) from the local SPCA.. there was a little hiding around going on and she's really shy but I know I wanted her...

anyways, i bought her and brought her home, but all the does is stay in the corner despite my best efforts to brush her, feed her, leave her alone while im at work.. i see she roams the house and walks around when im not home but the second she hears me or my roommate she hides under the couch in office room and she's getting progressive more hateful towards me... i have no idea whats wrong!

I've pulled her out maybe about once or twice a day to pet her and massage her.. give her a treat and then show her im cleaning her litter box and refilling her food and water but then she IMMEDIATELY swipes, hisses and then sprints away from me...

its been this way for 3 whole weeks nonstop. I've tried cat toys and albeit once my anger got the best of me from her clawing at my neck and i smacked her but oh my god i literally have no idea what left i can do...


for example this morning she was asleep on my computer chair and i walked by and petted her head and the second she looked up and saw me she clawed and snarled (not hissed!) and ran off! I didn't even do anything!

just her hearing my voice makes her hiss and i don't know whats wrong, im now resorting to lacing her food with catnip so she's at least docile enough to only growl but not claw at me nonstop.

The issue is that i play with him a lot when i get home from work, but even that doesn't stop it. I'm unsure of how to keep him occupied throughout the day so he's content by the time i get home.

He is a climber and I'm saving up for a cat tower so he can use it to his liking. Until i get the tower, am i just screwed?

-How do i get him to come when called?

If I'm in bed, he'll hop up on the bed and furiously purr the entire time, even if I'm not petting him. Bathroom? Wait outside the door. You get the idea.

When I'm sleeping, he will try to get as close to me as possible. He'll cuddle against any part of my body, but usually my arms or head.

Recently I've started walking her at 2am, when there is no one outside. Obviously being awake at 2am isn't always going to be my schedule, so I tried taking her outside earlier, at 10pm.

I took her outside, she immediately walked downstairs [I live on a second floor apartment] and started walking at her pace and sniffing the grass; all normal. Then she hears slight noises from someone's home [sounded like dishes being washed] and suddenly she doesn't want to walk. But she doesn't look afraid, she's decided to stick to one spot to sniff.

A door someone opens and she hears voices and starts flipping out, I immediately throw the towel I was carrying with me on her, and wrapped her in it and took her to a dark corner. 

The people went back inside and she proceeded to sniff around a bit like normal. Then people started walked towards us and she immediately ran into a thorny bush [well the leaves are thorny]. I just squatted there in front the bush while still holding her leash, waiting for the folks to pass. Afterwards she climbed through the other side of the bush and the leash was too tangled. I unclipped the leash, held her by the holster, and then clipped it back on. My cat hurriedly led me back upstairs and I took her back in. 

The thing is she LOVES going outside for walks. She's not desperate for it 24/7, she enjoys the window during the day, and at night, around 1am she'll meow at the exit door, telling me she wants to go on a walk.

I got her from a lady on Craigslist (I know, I know!) and only found out when I took her to the vet a week later that the woman lied about how old she was so she was definitely weaned wayy too early. I'm not sure if that's pertinent but I want to be thorough :p

In November I broke up with my ex so Saoirse and I moved in with my Mom, until January, when we got our own apartment. I've also taken her out of town with me various times (she has all her shots and boosters) so one thing I really like about her is that she has no problem with the carrier or the car and loves going new places and meeting new people. She's had a few negative experiences with dogs so she's not super fond of meeting new dogs which I would like to change eventually but that's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it. 

My main issues lately are all around the apartment issues: scratching at my bedroom/bathroom door when I want some time away from her, getting up on the kitchen counters and dining room table, and chewing on chords and other undesirables. 

She also chews on cardboard (and my records if I'm not watching her &gt;:|), I'm not sure if this is a compulsive/neurotic thing or some issue with her mouth. I know the why is a question for her vet but I was wondering what y'all do to get your cats to stop chewing on things they shouldn't? As far as wires, records and the like I try to keep all that as out of her reach as possible but it's not always possible and I can't be there all day to watch her.

The door scratching (especially) and table/counter jumping are my biggest issues right now. I feed her in the morning and at night before bed and leave the door slightly ajar for her to come and go while I sleep. Lately, she's taken to waking up at 5 am to lick my face (and any other exposed skin) and just bother me, in general, to come feed her. I never give in because I don't want her to think those methods are going to be fruitful. When she's particularly bothersome I lock her out of my room but she scratches violently at the door. I tried covering my door with double sided tape which didn't work, putting foil over that tape which also didn't work. I also have a squirt gun which I use for most unwanted behavior but lately, it's become ""how much can I scratch/sniff around the table/counters until I get squirted""
As soon as I open the door or walk towards her she runs away so the squirting isn't really effective either. 

She has a lot of toys as well as a cat tree and window perch/scratching post combo, but I'm worried that's actually adding to the problem. I can see how it would be confusing to differentiate between all the cat toys you are allowed to play with/chew/climb on and people things that you shouldn't.

I should also add that I would really like to let her outside but my apartment has a no off-leash policy. We're learning how to wander with a harness and retractable leash but that's not quite the same, and I don't see her being able to learn to hunt this way, but hopefully, when she's less scared she'll be more playful and get more energy out when we do go outside.",CatTraining,I've never had a kitten before and have no idea what I'm doing.

Every day they feed the new cat and either my dog or the other cat through a crack in the door so that positive associations can form. 

Thing is, the adoption agency said this could take months and that we can't let the cat out until their is no hissing at all because apparently cats can hold grudges. 

Anyways, we have experimented with letting the cat out for brief periods of time and do the baby gate/feed through the door thing twice a day.

My dog is super friendly and gentle with the cat and only nipped back at her one time out of the, like 100+ times this cat has hissed and swatted at her.

niznet25,1510552651,7cl5ya,5,False,3,"Hi everyone, I recently adopted a little kitten from someone who had rescued her. I'm not sure how old she is, probably around 3-4 months. The first night I brought her back, she peed on my bed. I changed the outer sheet she had peed on, but I guess she smelled her pee on the down comforter inside the new sheet because she peed there a second time.
The next day, she peed FOR THE THIRD TIME on the same exact comforter. I have since removed the down comforter and washed it, so I'm going to see if she does it again. The person we adopted from told us that she had already been litter-trained, but when we bought her the littler/litter box today, she hasn't used it at all. We'll repeatedly put her in there but she just jumps right out.

We were told from the beginning that he was shy and would need extra time to acclimate. At first things went well, he adapted quickly to the house, responded well to our affection and play time. After a few weeks however, his play became aggressive-- pouncing on us while we sleep, playing biting and scratching. Recently it has escalated to him biting us on the face at night, which, while we can tell it is play, is just not okay.

We have tried many things to stop or decrease the behavior but non of them seem to work. He is immune to spray bottles, will just lick the water off of himself but won't stop what he is doing. Distracting with loud noises or toys seem to just delay the reaction-- I will catch him getting ready to pounce and grab the feather wand (his favorite) and play with him until he is completely tired out thinking I have successfully stopping him.. only to be attacked 5 minutes later. We tried increasing the number of play sessions but he seems to always have energy to bite us.

DirtyToeLicker,1505528677,70eg45,5,False,2,"As the title suggests, I've been trying relentlessly to teach my girlfriend's cat not to lick himself while he's in the bed with us. It's not that I'm trying to instill a sense of discipline into him or anything like that, as I'm well aware that cats typically don't give a sh*t about anything except for birds, bugs, bits of string, and canned cat food/treats. It's just that when he licks himself, it's *very* loud (almost like someone slurping soup out of a spoon), and it shakes the bed a little bit when he really gets into it. That disgusting, stomach-churning sound alone drives me nuts, but when the bed starts shaking, even though it's ever-so-slightly, it sends me over the edge of frustration. I've got three different techniques that I use to get him to stop (although he just goes right back to it after about five seconds). The three techniques are:     
     
***1. Startling Him*** - I'll either clap my hands very loudly or slap my hand on the bed, also loudly. This gets him to stop for a few seconds.     
      
***2. Making a Loud ""PSSST"" Noise*** - Self-explanatory. I'll just make a loud ""PSST"" sound with my mouth. Again, this makes him stop for a few seconds.    
      
***3. Catching His Tongue*** - If within reach and my timing is right, I can catch his tongue between my index finger and my thumb when he's in mid-lick (yea, I just invented a word., so what?) I don't pull on it or squeeze hard enough to cause any harm, because I really do like her cat, but I'll catch it and hold it for a few seconds whilst saying aloud, ""STOP. LICKING. YOURSELF!"" As I doubt that he understands English, this method (like the other two) is really only effective for a few seconds. However, if I catch his tongue enough times back-to-back, he'll usually just say f*ck it and jump down off of the bed and go back to licking himself on the floor.       

Like I said before, none of these methods have any sort of effect which lasts longer than 5 or 6 seconds. I once read that cats simply *will not* respond to negative reinforcement, but there's no opportunity for positive reinforcement when trying to get a cat to *stop* doing something. I've started removing him from the bedroom and closing the door when my gf and I lie down to go to sleep, but this doesn't help during the day or in the evenings.     

What can I do? Are there *any* methods which might actually work? The cat is still pretty young, between 4 and 5 years old. I'm growing desperate here.

IHateAllYourCode,1505037924,6z7hmm,2,False,1,"Hey all, I don't know very much about cats and would like to describe my situation for some advice on what to do here.  

Cat:

Male of unknown breed, I believe it was neutered but I'm not certain.  White with big black spots, and a little black spot on the snout.  That, coupled with a black spot making a swoosh on it's forehead, makes it look very much like Hitler.  Albeit with green eyes.  So I've taken so calling him Kitler.

My allergy:

If I touch the cat or something the cat was on recently and then that makes contact with my eyes, they get super red and start watering, some areas of skin will become red/rash like for a bit, and with really extensive exposure I'll start having trouble breathing.  If I wash my hands or whatever after contact I get no subsequent reaction.

I recently moved into a new house and one of my housemates has a cat.  Since im allergic I normally would not move in somewhere with a cat, but it's a fairly large five bedroom house and it was hard to find non-crazy roommates anyway so I could deal with it.  Taking most allergy medicine prevents any reaction for the duration of the meds as well.

Well what I didn't anticipate is this cat very much likes being around people (I think it was bottle fed and the cats owner said that makes it interact more closely with humans, not sure if this is actually the case). Because of that it also bites a lot, all but drawing blood sometimes.

Normally if I'm either sleeping or up and doing stuff in the house it's fine because I keep my bedroom door closed so that whatever allergen it is I react to doesn't get on my sheets.  I play with it occasionally and that's also no problem when I wash my hands after.  

However when I'm in the living room watching TV or working in the pseudo-office we have in the sitting room, this is where things get weird.  A lot of times I'll be the only one awake in the house for various reasons and the cat will inevitably start hanging around with me.  Since I work from home occasionally I'm spending more time with the cat than the owner is at this point.

When I'm not moving around sitting somewhere,  it will creep up on me and bite me a little less than half the time.  It's not the worst, but it's extremely annoying when I'm trying to work or relax and have to constantly be on guard to shoo the cat away.  

The worst part though is that anywhere from 0-3 times a week the cat will pee on the floor in a specific corner of the office on the main floor, even when it has a litter box in the foyer that it is trained to use and uses it correctly in all other cases. 

 A few times it has done it when I am in the room.  I'll be working at my computer and I hear a faint tinkle, turn around, and see the cat pissing on the floor.  Staring at me.  My first instinct is to throw something or yell but then I remember how fast it runs away, meaning it would be running away that fast while also pissing which would be a nightmare.

So I sit there and stare back at it while it pisses in the same corner I've seen kitler do 5+ times.  I get the sense kitler is doing it on purpose often... If I didn't know better I would think kitler knows I'm allergic and tries to get me to react on purpose... But that might just be me going crazy.  It's also very unsettling to always be uncertain about whether the cat is in the room or not.  Maybe a bell would help with that?

It very much tries to walk on all surfaces, and we're all trying our best to keep it off the kitchen table, counters, and at least one couch.  This doesn't seem to deter him.  And every time I have to pick him up to move him off something i have to wash my hands again.  Kitler will just keep creeping towards me until he's on top of me or I shoo him away.  In all my experiences with cats they seem to gravitate towards me no matter what I do so I'm not sure what the deal is there.

One time I was going to the bathroom which is outside my room, closed the door, came back, opened my door, and the cat darted in out of no where before I could get the door closed again.  I was late for work and pissed so I start yelling at it which was the wrong move because it buried itself under my dresser and i had no way to get it out.  So I said fuck it, left the door open, and just ended up having to wash my sheets.  

It also will do what is akin to cat jousting.  It will line up with you and then dart past you, smacking you with its paw on the way.  I'm normally fine because I'm wearing pants but the cat's owner does get her legs scratched up like this.

None of these are huge problems but altogether frustrating to find myself fighting psychologically and sometimes physically with a 12 pound animal.  Over time I've become more resentful to kitler and he seems to sense it because he's become far more hostile towards me.  

I don't have any experience with training cats and the differences between them and dogs is very fundamental I've learned...  It's also not at all intuitive like it was training the dogs over had.

Like I said, I'm alone with the cat a lot and I was wondering if you guys had any advice about any training or things I could do for the issues I've ran into.  Specifically: keeping it off surfaces or specific areas, having it keep it's distance from me by default and letting it know when it can approach, keeping it out of my room without closing the door, how to let him know he did something bad without scaring him into pissing on the floor.  

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated thanks!!

I found a site with instructions for getting a cat to sit on your shoulder, and thought it sounded like a really fun idea, especially for one of the cats since she's often a bit hesitant to come towards people (but loves being petted all the same - you just have to go to her instead).

I bought a pointer/clicker thing and some cat treats, but... it's not going so well as I thought. I knew it wouldn't be an overnight thing, and I've only tried it today, but I thought they'd at least get the idea to follow the pointer after a while... The male one seems to get it about half the time - and I've even gotten him to jump up onto chairs and back down (ish - not consistently at all), but the female (who I most want to train) hardly gets it at all unless the pointer is right next to her, and even then sometimes just stares at it... I don't know how to train her if she doesn't understand to keep sniffing the pointer stick...

Another problem is that they're often in the same room - or, if I try to train the female, the male one (who is permanently wanting food) dashes in to try and get treats. I'm not sure how to separate them without just scaring the male one into the garden or something (I don't want to do that, though - but I've never picked up a cat before).

- Does it matter if I don't feed them by hand? I'm a little scared of them getting excited and swiping my hand with their claw, or nibbling at a finger accidentally...

- Also, should I train them just before feeding time, or perhaps slightly underfeed them, so that they are more motivated by the treats - and so that I'm not *overfeeding* them if I give them lots of treats during training?

- How long does it usually take before they're even at the stage of following the pointer consistently? 

- Should I repeat the basic sniffing the pointer 10-20 times before I try getting them to follow it at all?

- Is there anything special I should do to signal the end of training, or just put the pointer/treats away?

- And, is one week far too short of a timescale to train a cat to sit on my shoulders?

These are all shelter rescue cats, and other than the youngest being a kitten and annoying the other two from time to time, they have not had any serious conflicts until the last few weeks.

I adopted my lovely Nova a month ago. She has filled me with nothing but joy, happiness, and a wonderful companion. 

I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble adapting her to a sleep schedule recently, and she‚Äôs starting to shred my bed to pieces by playing on it at night when I‚Äôm trying to sleep. I have completely kitten proofed my studio apartment (keep that in mind, because the only room that has a door is the bathroom) but she always does what kittens do and that‚Äôs to play and act out hunting skills with her toys, but at the most inconvenient times lol

I‚Äôve tried suggestions from all over the internet to get her accustomed to what ‚Äúlights out‚Äù means, take away the loud toys at night, play with her LOTS during the day and right before bed, followed by a big meal to wear her out to sleep through the night.

Fox--Kit,1503840092,6wc4oq,4,False,3,"One of our cats is great, loves to cuddle, and sleeps with us every night at the foot of our bed. The other cat, the culprit cat, is fickle about cuddling, but sweet, and sleeps under the head of our bed. Culprit cat is the one who has landed on our faces, with hind claws, and heavy dense weight. =/ 

Both times have been accidents, but both times have resulted in deep gashes right above our left eyes. The first time was about a year ago when she jumped up to try to bat at some lights on the wall coming in from small holes in the blinds. So we keep the blinds shut all the time and have piled blankets up to block the holes. Also hung a blanket over the window. 

Since then, every time the culprit cat has come onto the bed near our face and gotten into the pose of looking at the wall, we've sprayed her with water and pushed her off. This has worked mostly, as she now doesn't see anything interesting on the wall over our faces.

The second time she has injured us, this morning (in the ER right now wtf), is because apparently she was chasing our other cat around, the two were having a jolly time, and culprit cat tried to take a short cut by jumping up with force and speed, apparently not understanding that she maybe shouldn't use my face as traction. 

So, my question is how the hell do I keep this from happening a third time?  And is it possible to have only one of our cats (the sweet one) be getting on the bed while keeping the culprit cat off? 

Both times we've been fortunate that she's just barely missed causing real damage to our eyes and vision. Other cat is very cuddly and spends most of the night on our bed, and she's perfect, so I don't want to outlaw all cat-bed interaction. And the culprit cat usually doesn't get on the bed at all, and only rarely cuddles with us in it. The problem seems to be these few times she jumps up trying to play or whatever, somehow not noticing our fucking faces are right there.

* Took her to the vet who said there was nothing physically wrong with her.

dapperlady,1502305058,6snnwa,2,False,1,"Hi, everyone.

I have a 3 year old neutered male cat who is quite the basket case. He was found injured very, very young (vet estimated 6-7 weeks) and I adopted him from the vet the day he was found. 

He was a very confident little guy. He seemed fearless. He walked up to any house guests like it was nothing, loved to play with my large dog, and chased our smaller dogs around. 

And then one day, it's like a switch flipped in his brain, and he was suddenly terrified of everything unfamiliar. I'm not sure if that's normal with cats (I live with other cats who seem much more balanced). 

Anyway, I'm moving out of my current place next year, and I'm expecting a total meltdown from my cat, so I'm looking to make the transition easier on him. 

The place we're moving to will be MUCH quieter since most of the animals we live with are not mine, and it will be me, the SO, our dog, brother in law, and a friend of ours. 

The cat does NOT do well with other people, and is already very cautious around the people he's lived with all his life (except my SO and me), so I think this will be the biggest challenge.

I'm already going to ask my new roommates to just ignore the cat completely for a while until he gets used to everything, but is there anything else I should do to help this transition?

We're also attempting to rent a house, but might end up with an apartment. Any tips to get him used to the noises associated with sharing walls with strangers?

I already plan on using Adaptil or another calming product in the week or so leading up to the move. I'm not sure if I should see my vet about getting something stronger. 

Thanks.

Edit: Actually, it just hit me, and I don't know how I didn't realize this before.

He was neutered at about 6 months (at the advice of our vet, who said it was best to do it early before he started spraying, since he was a stray), and when he came home is when his anxiety started. I don't know if it's due to the neuter, or if the employees traumatized him, or if it's just coincidental. ",CatTraining,Preparing very skittish cat for a move

maggiemoke7,1502124874,6s6ul6,2,False,2,"I moved in with my friend and her cat back in June. I've had my female long hair cat for over two years, and she adopted her male blue Russian mix within the last year. The Human Society said that he was returned by a family because he didn't work well with their cats. Both cats are fixed and around 5 years old, both considered strays at adoption. I am a first time cat owner, and my roommate had grown up with cats. I have trained my cat and the other cat to a certain point to respond to hissing noises as a deterrent for unwanted behavior (like the sound a spray bottle makes: tss tss). I'll make this noise and usually spray him with a water bottle if I catch him going into my room/the garbage/generally doing unwanted things. I'm going to start this off by admitting that I'm not sure if what I'm currently doing is the most effective/appropriate way to handle cat behavior.

My roommate's cat is becoming an issue. He's twice the size of my cat, and if I let her out of my room he will stalk and attack her. He jumps on her, bites her, and claws her. He usually gets her on her back so she doesn't have much room or time to fight back. I went on vacation for a week and I came back and her fur has a ton of huge knots/mats that I'm getting removed today. I asked my roommate about them and she said she didn't know so I'm assuming he at least had some part in creating them. This is not two cats play fighting. This cat jumps on her and pins her down. My cat screams (that's the best way I can describe the sound) like she's in pain. She's scared and timid now. The cats do get along sometimes; they'll lay on the same couch together and often do not pay each other much attention.

The other cat will not listen. If I leave my door open he will go in and use my cat's litter box and eat her food. He knows he's not supposed to go in there. If we catch him sneaking over we just need to say his name or start to move and he darts back into my roommate's room. But he continuously tries to go in there and I catch him in there all the time. He's eaten a bunch of her expensive food. He also knocks over the garbage can almost every day to get food in there. We've talked about getting a covered can but we haven't yet. He'll also use my cat's litter box and then she won't use it and pees on the couch, which is another problem that needs to be dealt with. 

One issue that could cause the food stealing behavior is how we feed our cats. My cat is very small, 6lbs. She free feeds throughout the day and I usually give her half a can of wet food. Since she's so small, she never eats a lot at once. Even if I try to feed her a small amount in the morning and one at night, she won't finish it. She doesn't even finish the spoonful of wet food I give her daily. She just doesn't need/want that much at once. So there's not a good way to ensure that she's eating all of her food without the other cat eating the rest of it unless I close my door. The other cat gets fed in the morning and at night. Like a quarter cup dry food and wet food when my roommate wakes up and when she gets home at night. He's a fat cat, probably 15-20lbs, so it's not like he's not getting enough food. He'll even have food in his bowl and still eat my cat's food. My roommate claims she's tried to feed him my brand food before (Science Diet) and he wouldn't eat it. I could understand that maybe he doesn't like his food or it's not filling enough or something.

When he does these things my roommate just gives me an exasperated sigh and says stuff to the cat like: ""why did you do this"" and ""oh you're such an asshole"" and she'll spray him with a water bottle if she catches him in the act. But otherwise she'll cuddle him and talk sweet to him right after. I've had to resort to keeping my cat locked up in my room all day if we're not home, which is not fair. She's getting stir crazy. Roommate's cat has already and will continue to tear up the carpet by the door if any door is closed. He's done it to my door and the bathroom door. I asked my roommate to start closing him up sometimes so my cat isn't going stir crazy trapped in my room. She protested saying that he'll tear up the carpet but I said he already has. She agreed to close him up sometimes. She said she'll pay for the carpet.

Sorry if this is really long and if there are grammar/format issues. This is my first time posting and I wanted to give as many details as I could. I'm basically wondering what we could do to get these behaviors under control. Our lease isn't up until June and there's no possibility of either of us giving up our pets. Let me know if you have any questions.

__blackcat__,1502105446,6s4xdu,3,False,3,"Greetings,

My mother was devastated after the death of her former shelter cat at the age of 20. One month ago we went to the local shelter and filled out a questionnaire to be matched with a fitting candidate for adoption. We live downtown in a large city, so we were looking for an indoors only apartment cat. We were matched with a Russian Blue mix, Annie, who was estimated to be around two years of age and didn't like other cats. She was spayed a few weeks before at the shelter, is chipped and vaccinated and was checked through thoroughly by their vet.

We took her home that day and everything seemed uncomplicated at first, except for that she attempted to run out of the apartment door when there was a chance. She is a very chatty little cat that follows you from room to room, and is very playful.

Annie has plenty of toys that she will play with by herself. My mother is retired and plays with her, as do my husband and I when we visit. She can look out onto two balconies, with the largest one having her cat tree nearby so she gets the best view.

Over the weeks, though, Annie's behavior has become gradually more and more aggressive.

It started with her nipping at hands when she'd had enough of petting or didn't want to be touched.

Now she has picked up biting and scratching completely unprovoked. I think in part it's a game, as she will stalk you and then dash forward, jump up and claw at your hands and bite. However, she also bit and scratched my husband bloody last week when we came by as he picked up one of her toys while she was otherwise occupied. He let go of the toy, loudly said, ""Ouch! No!"" and was slowly turning around as she dashed forward and bit him a second time in the hand. Over the weekend, Annie jumped on my mother's back and clawed her up as she was bending down in front of the apartment door to pick up some bags.

The door is another point of contention. At absolutely every opportunity she makes a mad dash to the door and tries to wrestle her way out. I'm afraid that my mother will slip and break something one of these times as she tries to hold Annie back. No matter if someone is coming or going, she shows this behavior 100% of the time.

If she hears someone in the hallway, she will sit in front of the door and whine, hoping that they will open it. When nothing happens, she calms down after some minutes and goes back to doing whatever she did before.

Since her behavior is that desperate, she has managed to escape numerous times within the last two weeks. She usually runs at full speed all the way down the stairs into the basement, until she finally reaches the next closed door. I fear that one of these days with some bad timing someone will come in though the entrance door and she will escape onto the street and into traffic. Chasing her down and bringing her back into the apartment is another challenge, as she will try to evade you and run past you out of the basement up into the higher levels of the building.

My husband has tried to walk her with a cat harness, which worked perfectly once. It was so easy putting it on the first time. She walked on it without a problem, so we let her discover the balconies while on the leash. When we tried the second time, she fought being placed in the harness, and we haven't tried since.

Lastly, another problem is Annie's excessive vocalization. While being adorably chatty in a soft voice during the day, she will whine and howl during the night at the apartment door to the extent that my mother can't sleep and we are worried the neighbors will complain sooner or later if she keeps it up in this intensity.

We thought maybe she was in heat, but she was definitely spayed by the vet at the shelter about six weeks ago now. Her behavior is getting worse by the day instead of improving. My mother is heartbroken by the experience. Is there any chance to rescue the situation, or is she simply not the right cat for my mother?

Kellfoxx,1501319779,6qa25x,2,False,3,"Hello,

I've been having a lot of trouble with my cat, Minerva lately. I adopted her a few months ago and she is a very sweet and affectionate cat but she struggles to be friendly with other people and instead, chooses to hide. When it comes to my boyfriend especially, she will never go near him. In fact, just the sound of his footsteps makes her visibly so scared she cowers in front of him (and cannot be re consoled for hours) or she just crawls under any space or crevice she finds. We're currently in the process of living in an in-between house because our new apartment is not set up yet so she's already freaked out because of the move entirely, now she's dealing with the stress of being in a new place and not finding comfort in the safe room because my boyfriend is there. I'm not sure when this happened, he's not abusive and has tried multiple times to approach her calmly, this happened with our last two cats. While I can accept the fact that he may not make cats feel comfortable all the time, I've never seen cats so scared of one person. If he doesn't feel that they like him, he'll make sure to find a way to avoid them or just mind his own business. But Minerva now has been hiding under the couch during the day and coming out at night which causes problems for us because I am sleeping and cannot keep track of her, especially now with our living room so piled up with stuff. She keeps checking the underside of the couch and I know that as soon as I let her out there to explore that's the only place she'll want to be. I would very much like some advice on how to get her to become more friendly with people and my boyfriend. Not only this, but at night she chews on furniture and because I have an early morning job I can't stay up all night to watch.

The elderly cat dislikes other cats but she has lived with another cat for over a year prior to us moving in together and lived with dogs prior to that. So living with other animals is not new to her. 

She keeps pooping everywhere but the litter box, as the title states. My partner spent probably close to a grand to ensure that there is nothing wrong medically speaking. She has no bowel issues (if anything, her bowel movements have improved since we moved in together and she switched to the food I give my cat), she has no heart or lung issues or stomach problems, and there is no cancer. 

This morning she pooped on my partners pillow, got down on the floor, pooped more, then moved to a baby quilt that my grandmother made for me when I was born and peed on that, then peed on another blanket. As I was cleaning up from that she went in the other room. Followed her in and she was pooping on the floor. It's been 2 hours and I went in the bedroom for my phone charger and found she pooped on the bed three times. 

We've tried everything we can think of. We've used pheromone diffusers, we've used carpet cleaner with enzymes/essential oils that are supposed to discourage pooping in certain spots again, we've had to take away the cat beds that my cat loves, changed the litter numerous times to different brands (and change the litter completely on a regular basis/try to clean the box twice a day). 

There is absolutely no reason that we can think of for the ongoing behavior. And I'm at my wits end with it. We live in an apartment and it's destroying the carpet, as well as our blankets and furniture.

manofsteel32,1501197078,6pztji,3,False,2,"Hi Cat Trainers,

My girlfriend moved in six months ago with Spock, a two year old Spynx male, and Lumi, a one year old Sphynx female from the same mom. Spock is smart and nice, Lumi has low confidence and is a bit skiddish. The cats were quiet before they moved in. They have their phases of neediness, but lately Lumi's gotten out of control.

From exactly 530am-630am (I wake up at 630) Lumi will meow very loudly in the living room or bedroom door. We'll call her over and pat the bed and she'll happily come up and force her head into our hands and purr very loudly (too loudly, like to the point where it doesn't sound like purring (my girlfriend said she was taken out of heat too early (late?) whatever that means).

Once the petting stops however (aka I fall back asleep) Lumi will jump out of bed and start the meowing process all over again. This can go through anywhere from 3-6 cycles every morning. The only way we've been able to fully stop her is by sandwiching her under the blanket where she's kind of stuck and pet her a ton until she falls asleep (they both like sleeping under the blankets and stealing out body heat).

Ignoring her definitely doesn't work, she has a lot more patience than we do (over an hour's worth), putting her outside isn't an option, we've tried playtime before bed and will continue to do so, closing the door was a disaster, and I'll feel bad if I resort to the water gun.

Last night I adopted a new cat. She is 4 years old and healthy and beautiful.

The problem is that our limited interactions so far have consisted of her biting the living sh!t out of me.

She is declawed at the front by the previous owner so she is resorting to biting when scared. I totally get that.

Here is my question. Should I just leave her alone until she is used to the new place? She lived in a big house before and i live in a much smaller apartment. So I imagine this is a big shift for her. She was also apparently really really loyal to her owner (would follow her around when she was having bad days, etc). So not having her owner must be heart breaking for her too.

So should I just leave her alone for a few days? She hisses at me whenever i get within 2 meters of her. I don't know if I am supposed to force small interactions or leave her alone for a while until she is okay with the apartment first.

The other thing is, how long is long enough? If i leave her for 2 weeks and she does not come out of her shell at all, should I call it quits and give her back? 

Cats I have had in the past took maybe 3 days before they were totally fine walking and running around and playing with me. But none of them have been this aggressive towards me. So i imagine this is going to take a lot longer.

I had to force her out from under my bed last night because all her food bowls and litter are in the living room and I was afraid she would pee and poo there if she didn't know where her stuff was. I had to use a towel to get her out because she would freak out whenever I got near her. My hands are scarred all over from that attempt. This morning she hissed as I walked past her hiding spot so i just gave her some room.

Sunday she didn't move from her tower. She was receptive if we came over and would chat with us and ask for pets, but didn't get up or move. She would hiss if the other cats get too close to the tower, but we kept them locked up in the bedroom if we were home to watch them interact.

Monday she still hasn't moved, hadn't gotten up to drink water, she had eaten a treat or two, hadn't gotten up to pee. I'm starting to worry. Boyfriend tries to pick her up and make her walk around the apartment while the other cats are put away. Shes not super thrilled and goes to hide in the bathroom. He tries to expose the cats to each other, my cats just want to sniff her, she's hissing a lot.

Monday night he's trying to just get her to sniff the other cats, and I suggest that he picks her up and sits on the couch and I'll hold JB and sit on the other side and just let them be next to each other while they have their person. She pees on him. I don't know if its because she hasn't relieved herself in two days or because she was so terrified.

She lived with my Bf's ex when she was little and didn't have the best home life. They had to avoid dogs who weren't trained to be around little kitties. But my kids haven't been aggressive to her, JB is just curious about Bonnie.

How can we help her be more comfortable? She's not eating, drinking or peeing (unless its on my boyfriends clean shirt) and she seems to be pretty terrified and miserable. I love Bonnie, and know there's always some anxiety with moves and with meeting other kitties (especially with her history) but I really don't want to have to find part of our family a new home (the move is stressful enough without the thought of breaking up the family already). Is there anything we can do besides give her time?",CatTraining,"Blended family: moving in together and introducing our cats, one is miserable and we want to help!"

The problem is that the new kitten is constantly screaming and yowling. not for attention because when we pick him up or go to pet him he doesnt stop. we assume he does it for food. Because we both work and go to school the kitties get put in my bedroom whenever we are out of the house. Whenever we shut the door or just come home the kitten screams his head off to be let out.

Also, once let out the room the kitten sprints into the kitchen and continues to meow and scream(even if theyve been fed earlier that day)

strawberryblondes,1497906772,6i9fi8,8,False,2,"Hi, 
( on mobile so sorry about formatting) 

So a few weeks ago I rescued a kitten from outside. The vet estimated he was about 6 weeks so he should be right around 9 weeks now. He had fleas, worms, and the feline herpes virus. (All fine now) 

When we first got him I thought he was deaf because he didn't respond to any noises (dishwasher, hairdryer, us calling him) but now he sometimes does. He still doesn't really meow, but he's trying too now! It's more of a squeak or a croaking noise.

Now that he is feeling better and more settled in he significantly more playful. However he is now biting and scratching a lot. 

I can be sitting on the bed and he will dart out of nowhere and pounce on me and wrap all four paws and bite me. At first it was just nibbling but now he is biting hard. When he does this I pick him up and set him on the ground and ignore him. He goes back to some toys and then does it again in a few minutes. 

He wakes me up in the morning by nibbling my fingers or my nose. At first this wasn't a problem because he couldn't make a sound to wake us up and he was hungry. He was only able to eat wet food (trying this week to start transitioning him to dry food)

He is now more aggressive with that too.
He only does this with me, not my boyfriend, who is home most of the day aside from class/research but I work typically 8-5. 

I noticed this behavior got a lot worse after I started giving him his antibiotics by dropper. I'm also the one who gives baths, and is cleaning up the wound in his tail he keeps biting. Aka I'm the mean parent. 

At night he still sleeps and cuddles with us both. He loves to play with us both (he is very particular about taking turns to throw when we play fetch with him)

He has laser, wand toy, balls, mice, a little house(that he sleeps in top of and falls off instead of inside) a scratching boards, and more. We play and get him running and moving several times throughout the day ( and try to wear him out as much as we can) but are trying to increase that now. 

In short, how do I try and decrease the aggressive biting and scratching and surprise attacks. Because frequent playing and new toys isn't helping.

sometimesigobyryn,1497401495,6h464l,4,False,1,"Hi there! 


This may end up being a long post so I hope I can get all the information across in a good way but I wanted to preface this rant with a disclaimer!


I'm fostering a solo kitten who was found as a stray and brought to a local humane society. They claimed he was 6 weeks old (only 1lb) at the time but after doing some research on baby kittens I believe he was closer to 4 or 5 weeks. The first week and a half was pretty rough, he wasn't eating or drinking and his stool (when there was some) was extremely loose, he was dehydrated and very lethargic. I set him up in a small/medium sized dog crate in my living room to keep him safe from my two adult cats (8 and 9 years) and my two dogs. I've nursed him back to health with KMR (among other things) and he's pretty regularly eating kibble now and drinking plenty along with his insatiable appetite for shredded wet food.


I'm afraid I have failed his socialization though because he was so week and tiny he didn't get much time out of the crate and around the other animals or humans until this past week. I was afraid that he was sick and after stool samples sent in came back negative I started letting him out of his crate for small amounts of time periodically throughout the day. 


He's extremely feisty now and just doesn't like being touched at all, much less held. When he was finally eating wet food and getting around okay he used to ride on my shoulder and would regularly be fed in my arms but now he wants nothing to do with me. He screams bloody murder if he's in the crate or if he's being touched and will pretty reliably swat and try to bite whatever part of me happens to be near him at whatever time he gets in his grumpy mood. He plays mostly to himself and will occasionally ""buck up"" to my two resident cats but still can't figure out why they wont play with him when he charges at them all poofed up and crazy-eyed. He doesn't hiss or actively try to attack them, he's just socially inept. Maybe my cats aren't the teaching type?


I haven't had a kitten since my 8 year old was 6 weeks old and she never did any of this when she was younger. She's had her moments of grumpy-ness but has always sought human attention and affection. She seems to love him but he's just too much for her because he's so rough. 


I've tried playing with him with cat wands and distancing my hands from play time, even when it comes down to him trying to bite my hands I shove a toy in his mouth and stop the interaction. I have also tried slowly petting him in various spots on his body while he does things he enjoys but he will stop eating/playing/etc when he sees my hand coming for him. Have I scarred him from picking him up when he was little and putting him in his crate multiple times a day since he hates being in there?


Am I doing this right? I want to help raise a social little dude but I'm afraid I've made him into kind of a jerk! His future home will have an adult female around 7-8 years old and I want him to be okay with her and his future adopter.  

He is not neutered yet but will be before he goes into his permanent home. Does this affect his temperament at all? Is he going through his angsty ""teen"" years? What can I do to let him learn that people are good and I'm here to help him be the best little dude possible? Am I projecting dog behavior onto a kitten?",CatTraining,"Fostering a 6-8 week old kitten, behavior issues abound!"

So today my girlfriend's cat started doing something I've never seen him do before. I spend the most time with him as my girlfriend works and I work from home. He's never been abnormally aggressive towards me, and isn't usually vocal.

But today, he sat on my new desk (just put it together last night) and started yowling. He has a small basket to sit in, but he sat next to it and stared at me, yowling and swatting at my hands. These were long yowls too, and he would swat at me and bite any time I got too close, or tried to do something with my hands. I had to throw him out of the room to write this. He's walking around and doing his normal day to day stuff now, but I don't know what could be causing this. Should I be concerned?

I got up and fed him the first time he did it after a minute or two, but he came back and did the same thing. The two separate incidents took place over about 5 minutes with him yowling most of the time. Now, about 10 minutes later, he is normal, like nothing happened. Was he acting out? Was he angry about something? Any tips are appreciated.

My sister has two cats, orange floof and cashmere cat (not actual names, but I know my sister is lurking in Reddit and I don't want to be caught asking for help)

So, the situation is that my sister got two kittens before she was ready, she was still recovering from the sudden and tragic loss of her previous two cats (neither lived longer than two years so understandably she was taking it pretty hard and quite personally. Then had these two kittens dropped in the middle of her grieving.) I tried to warn her that she needed to make a bond with the kittens and play with them if she wanted them to love her.

At the same time, I was coping with the fact that my cat was starting to lose his fight with his health. As a result, I was aggressive about keeping her kittens behaved around my cat. As in if they were getting to rough, I put them in a different room or took my buddy to my room so he could have quiet time. It took about a month for her kittens (at 4 months old) to learn my rules, so clearly the idiots are smart. And as a result, they left me and my cat alone, unless they got permission; and they constantly demanded my sister's attention.

*so to the point of the issue* since my cat lost his battle in September, her kittens won't leave me alone. Granted, she's sometimes kinda rough with them and I tried mentioning they don't seem to enjoy the rough handling. All that did was cause her to have a meltdown. Her orange floof wants to sleep in my bed with me. He actually will race me up the stairs, singing, just to climb into my bed. Her cashmere cat wants to be picked up all the time and demands to cuddle on the couch.

This is causing her to be insanely stressed and jealous.

It upset me for a while because they're mimicking my black cat's behaviors. Although, they've kinda grown on me because I'm lonely.

So I thought to put a stop to their preference change by ignoring them, forcing her to play with them more, making her get up in the mornings to feed them and feeding them dinner. 

These changes caused the kittens to get upset, which caused my sister to have a meltdown because she thinks they don't love her, which led to the idea that I'm not allowed to ignore them because it upsets them which upsets her, reinforcing their desire to play and cuddle with me, which reinforces her theory that they don't like her.

He's 6 pounds of love, was neutered beginning of May, has all of his shots/vaccinations, and seems very healthy. His affection at the shelter is what made me instantly know this is the little guy who is going to change my world, but I want to make sure I'm doing everything the right way. I've been reading countless articles, but he still seems too scared to venture out of the bathroom on his own. I'll list my progress with him for specifics:

Tuesday: Brought him home. Initially let him explore my living room (I learned the error of my ways with this). He hid under my couch for a while, then sat in my garden window for the rest of the evening to observe my fianc√© and I. He did not eat or use the bathroom, but seemed somewhat receptive to us petting him every hour for a little bit.

Wednesday: Woke up to poop on my couch (this is totally my fault; he didn't know any better, so I wasn't upset. Kinda grossed out, but not upset). He was hiding near the steps to my basement. I then read several articles stating I should've kept him initially in a small space like a bathroom or laundry room, so I moved him and his litter box, food/water, toys, and blankets upstairs in my bathroom since it has more counter space. By the evening, I spent in hour in there with him. Prior to that, I was coming in once an hour with the door shut. He was being VERY affectionate, seemed more at ease, let me pick him up, and sat on my lap with me on the floor. After that, I stood up and he jumped back up on the counter. I put his food in front of him (I have it on the floor next to the counter in case he knocks it off otherwise) and he started eating. So thrilled for that progress! But I noticed he was only eating if I was doing that.

Thursday (today): I checked his litter box and discovered that he's been using it, told him how proud of him I am, and then cleaned it. Awesome! So it made me realize he was just totally overwhelmed by my living room and I didn't properly introduce him to it until moving him in the bathroom. He also ate this morning with me standing next to his food bowl up on the counter, the same way I fed him last night. I decided to leave the bathroom door open today with my bedroom door shut to see if he would venture out on his own with me in there, but he is still refusing to move from the counter and out of the room, despite his affection when I'm in there with him. I was petting him for a little bit and he allowed me to pick him up and bring him on my bed, which he laid next to me for about an hour. When I brought him back to the bathroom, I placed him on the floor close to the door and he ran back into the bathroom and up on the counter. For the last hour, he still hasn't moved from that spot.

Is there anything I should or shouldn't be doing to get him more comfortable with venturing out, or is it just a matter of staying patient and continuing to leave the door open and let him venture out on his own will? I wasn't sure if I should or shouldn't pick him up and bring him on my bed, but he seemed really happy when I did and curled up next to me the whole time.

I've done a lot of research already and tried the following tactics:

1) Taken both cats to the vet to make sure it's not a health issue (they are both healthy)
2) Ignored cats (works sometimes)

1) She bites. You'll be stroking her and she'll be loving it until she suddenly decides she doesn't. It's not as if I'll be stroking her head and then suddenly move to her stomach or something, that would be understandable; you can stroke her in the same area for ages with no problem and then she will all of a sudden decide she doesn't like it. In fairness to her she doesn't bite down so it doesn't actually hurt but I'd rather she didn't do it at all.  


2) This one is the weird one. Since we brought her home she's been brilliant with using her litter tray but over the last week her behaviour has been really odd. During the day she will wee and poo in the litter tray just fine- it gets cleaned out when I come home from work and she'll be perfectly happy to use it in the evening. But overnight she will only use the litter tray to wee and will crap on the floor in front of the litter tray instead.

My cat is about 4 years old and has been peeing outside the litter box for 2-3 years off and on. He is currently living in my mum's house (indoor cat), with his brother (bonded pair). The peeing has gotten to the point where my mum wants to rehome him. It happens a few times per week. I don't know what to do.

He tends to pee on fabrics, often beds/couches/laundry. Sometimes on the floor. I believe it's marking - they've had the same litter since they were kittens and it's kept spotless, so shouldn't be a management issue. They get along fine (grooming each other, sleeping tigether, playing together) so it shouldn't be a territory issue either.

We've tried feliway, ""calming"" food, multiple boxes, meds (he's currently on Clomicalm but it hasn't really done much except make him a zombie), trip to vet to check for UTI (he's fine). My mum is going to try adding another litter box with softer litter this week. He has scratch posts on both floors of the house. 

Is it worth it to get a behaviourist? Is there even anything else we can do? He's so anxious and it makes me so sad to see how upset he is. They're living in the basement now because my mum can't deal with pee on her furniture anymore.

(One cat is 1 year and the other cat in question is an 8 month old) Until our youngest cat started peeing blood and had a few ""accidents"". 

We went to the vet and we came to the conclusion it was probably stress induced UTI and we got pain medication. From there it went downhill. He started to use any excuse to go somewhere that isn't the litterbox. So we decided to do a urine test. 

For the context, it was at the end of the month and I already spent too much of my savings. So we looked for a cheaper vet to do the urine test. The test said he had struvite (bladderstones) and that his bladder was really agitated and we got antibiotics. 

Went back to my own vet after the weekend to get insanely expensive bladder stone food, and they wouldn't sell it to me because they didn't have the test results. So they called the vet I went to and it came out that the test was faultive because the urine was too old (So we wasted 20 euros on nothing and alot of stress to look for a cheaper solution). So they told me to finish the antibiotics and come back for another test. 

In the meanwhile the peeing in the house got worse and worse, I'm still looking for a job so I'm home all day and I have to keep an eye on him CONSTANTLY. 

Found out that the moment I look away he pees anyways. I keep putting him by the litterbox every time I see him ""searching"", and now he refuses and puts up a fight when I put him by the litterbox, and just now after I did that, he walks away from the litterbox, looks me RIGHT IN THE EYE, lifts up his tail and pees on my curtain!

Distend,1488645474,5xhpne,8,False,5,"My cat is 17 and is the neediest creature I've ever met in my life. It's especially bad at night. If we close the bedroom door, she yowls VERY loudly for hours on end, which keeps us awake all night. Ear plugs are not an option as I have dumb ears that overproduce wax and cause me to lose my hearing if I'm shoving it further down with plugs. Anyway, if we leave the door open and let her inside, she begs for attention until we get up in the morning. I'm talking meowing in our faces, licking our hands and faces, biting our hands and feet, laying down on our faces/backs/arms and making biscuits, running around like a psycho and using our bodies as a springboard. I am at my wit's end with her. We get up at 4AM Monday through Friday, so sleep is incredibly important. 

The following options are out:

- Crating her/putting her in another room: we live in a small 1-bedroom apartment where we can hear her no matter what room we put her in. 
- Playing with her before bed: we play with her all day. In fact, if we're home, we're playing with her or petting her in some way. She is the center of attention at all times. See the extremely needy part above. 
- Testing for health problems - I work at a vet that exclusively sees cats. This was the very first thing I did, and we have ruled out all of the normal causes of excessive vocalization through extensive, expensive blood work and exams. Yay for employee discounts! 
- Supplements: I actually just haven't found one that works for her yet. Feliway, Rescue Remedy, and Zylkene have had no effects on her.
- Getting another cat to keep her company: she HATES other cats and is extremely aggressive toward them. I have had her live with another female in one house and two other females in another house recently, and she will attack them any time they come near, even after living together for over a year in both places.

He is a normal cat at all other times. He can get a bit hyper, but when he does we try to redirect it or reduce the stimulation. We live in a bachelor apartment, and I swear half the place is taken up by his things, so its not for lack of things to do. Like I said, perfectly normal when we arent sleeping.

However, whenever we sleep (even if its during the day) he will instantly think its time to ""play"". Or maybe hunt is the right word? He jumps on us, full claws and teeth and no holding back. He'll get caught up in my hair and bunny kick my head, and wrestle my arm biting it. Scratching, biting, nothing is off limits. It's causing some serious damage. He only does this to exposed parts, nothing under the blanket. He also only does this if we are both sleeping or trying to sleep. It doesn't happen if one of us is awake. He wont attack a moving part if its under a blanket, and he will maul even if you're not moving an inch. Sometimes he just comes up, lays on you, leans his head forward and bites as hard as he can at any exposed skin.

I'm starting to be worried about getting clawed in the eye, as he can be pretty nasty. We don't smack him if we can help it, but getting bit in the face from a dead sleep can be a little startling. Currently we scruff him and remove him from the bed.

My cat Rajah is almost 3 years old and she does not really have any behavior issues. She is very affectionate with me and social. We lived in an apartment for 2 years that was all carpet and she always did her business in her litter box, even when it was messy. 

She did have UTI problems that I found out when she had been peeing on my bathroom rug and we got that fixed.

We have two litter boxes in the basement for them, and I have caught her in the act of and have found that she pees frequently on the concrete floor next to the litter boxes. I even set her in the box once and she peed outside of it in front of me. She doesn't seem to understand this is wrong. Any help or advice? I am sort of at a loss here.

She now lives with just me. I've had her for almost 2 months and she is still so afraid of everything. Even me. When I go to pet her she ducks away but then she'll come over and lay next to me and purr and let me pet her until shes over it and LIGHTLY bites me then walks away. She HATES being picked up. Sometimes she seems comfortable, but most of the time, she seems offish or afraid.

My goal is to completely toilet train her, as changing two litter boxes for one cat each week is expensive.

I just purchased the Litter Kwitter, now I'm curious on how best to go about training her at the new place.

The kitten will be playing with a toy and the older cat will give a double meow, come up and try to claw him, jump on him and bite the back of his neck. I have to shout at him and take them apart. He doesn't hiss though. I'm assuming he's realized the kitten isn't dangerous and that he is in fact stronger and can do what he wants.

Here are my 3 primary issues with him and I'd appreciate if anybody can share any ideas on how to help correct this behavior.

1. He used to bite my feet, and I learned early on that you shouldn't train a kitten to play with your feet and I stopped doing that, however he would still every now and then collapse right in front of me and bite my feet. One time I took a spray bottle and purposely put my feet on his belly and sprayed him every time he attempted to bite. Now he doesn't ever bite my feet but I feel like he is now taking it out on other people. Friends who visit often, he tends to bite them or try to knick them. Like if they're sitting down at a bar stool he will just come up and bite them really hard on the feet. Other times he'll try and bite their hands when they try to pet him, although he's even bitten me when visitors are over.

2. Every time I sit down to eat, he will do a few things, like he'll jump up on the TV and I have 2 fake bamboo trees in the living room and he will start trying to tip it over. One time he almost tipped over a speaker. This is a recurring pattern where any time I grab food he will come over and want a bite, then throw a fit and I have to lock him in the laundry room for a little while or close the doors on him. I have an automated feeder that feeds him 3 times a day and I give him wet food too, so he's not hungry either.

3. He's constantly jumping on the countertops when I'm not looking. He knows he's not supposed to be on there and when I come out he immediately jumps on it. I have an electric shock mat I tried using but he is just too smart and he just walks around it or jumps over it. I've even tried the sticky tape and it doesn't seem to matter to him much anymore. They fill up with hair so quickly it's difficult for them to have an impact.

They are 5 months old, been with us about a month. Mine was weaned too early and bottle fed by his foster parents. When he first arrived he was super friendly but was hyperactive 23 hours of the day and unconscious the rest. Now that he's chilling out a bit he's began woolsucking,generally when he's been cuddling for a while or on warm nights when he's about to take a nap, so it's when he's happy, not when he's stressed out. 

We're curbing the behaviour by covering all of his ideal mom-substitutes with less-suckable fabric, which is fine, but I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with training behaviour in kittens in this way about how long we need to do this for to break the habit? I know every cat is different, and I expect him to be on the longer side of things, because he's both tenacious and kind of lovably dumb. (We have to train them in separate rooms because his sister picks up on things so much more quickly she'll knock him aside to perform for whatever treat is being offered, while he gets distracted by imaginary ghost bugs.) He's also not very treat/praise/petting/toy motivated, which makes positive reinforcement  trickier (but not impossible, just got to catch him in the handful of hours a day he's not practicing for the kitten triathlon.)

He'll hunt down even a single inch of fuzzy fabric and contort himself into the most hilarious shapes to position himself to knead and suck on it, so we have to be pretty diligent about keeping things covered, especially since our winter blanket is one of his victims.  

We're also training them to stay off a bunch of counters and the PlayStation by covering them in tin-foil, which is super effective on the cats, but I know my roommates are getting a little impatient with living in Tin Foil Hat World and I'd love to give them some kind of estimation on when we could start trying to take the tin foil off and see if they've forgotten those surfaces exist. Another month? Or more like another 6 months? I don't want to de-kitten proof my home too soon and then feel like I have to start all over again! If it's more like a year I'll start finding ways to integrate the kitten proofing measures into my home in a more aesthetically pleasing way, especially since both my roommate and I have pretty severe issues with winter depression and cabin fever so our house can't look messy or we go crazy in a way not even kittens can cure. :)

He's a deaf, three-legged cat who sleeps all day until its time to eat then he pesters a *little bit* for food in the afternoon.  This is fine, but it's the early morning we have a problem with.  When Purpy decides that he wants breakfast he will scream the house down (and i mean literally scream!).  If we're lucky he might not start until 6:30-7am.  Most of the time it starts at around 4:30-5am, sometimes earlier.  This morning he started at around 3:30am.

He will not stop until he gets fed.  Putting him outside doesn't work as he just screams outside and its just as annoying.

How do we get around this?  We've tried feeding him before we go to bed in the hope that he'll still be full by morning, but that doesn't work.

The most frustrating thing is, the couple does not seem to realize that their cat is the problem. They continue to rationalize her behavior and blame my cat and my other roommate's cat for yowling and hissing when they are attacked. The do feel bad, and are upset when our cats are injured enough to bleed, which has already happened on many occasions (one even resulted in a trip to the vet).

She will bite and scratch me without warning, and it's not play biting. She also hisses at me for no reason. Here are a couple examples from the last couple days to illustrate what I mean:

1. Yesterday I was sitting in front of my fireplace and the cat was next to me. She then decided to try to crawl behind my back (between me and the couch I was leaning up against). It was uncomfortable, so I sat up and turned around, intending to pick her up and move her. I try never to surprise her or touch her without giving her a bit to smell me first, so I put my hand out for her to smell and she was fine with it. So I moved to pick her up and she growled, bit, and scratched me.

2.) The cat is not allowed in the bedroom closet, but she always tries to get in anyway. Usually she just gets shooed away and it's fine. This morning I was getting something out of the closet, and saw her headed toward me from across the room. She was a good five feet away from me at least when I noticed her, so I turned and said ""Hey! No!"" and she stopped and hissed at me twice. 

She never behaves this way with my husband, just with me, and it's not consistent. Sometimes she's cuddly and normal with me. She's not a timid cat. She doesn't startle easy or run off, which can be a problem. If she's startled she holds her ground and gets aggressive instead of running away.

iGeminiSoul,1472083231,4zfn88,0,False,3,"Hello,

I have an issue with my 2 cats fighting. Well more like one thinks he's the king cat and bullies the other cat. They're about 3 years old and they're brothers. The brown cat seems to be very territorial of my wife and I and also the house in general. It's been happening for 2 years now. Pretty much when they grew out of being kittens the bully cat started acting more aggressive. The other cat was my old house-mates cat before he had to move.

The brown cat will chase and pretty much beat up the other cat when he gets the chance. Maybe when he's bored? We play with him and he'll still chase the other cat out of the room at times. It's really hard for both cats to play around each other. They kind of just take turns so the play sessions can take a really long time =(

In the morning when I feed them wet food they get along well. They eat right next to each other. The brown one will try to steal food for the other cat sometimes. My wife says the cats are more peaceful and these conflicts don't happen much when I'm not home. Maybe the brown bully cat is possessive of me? What can I do to make the fights stop or at least happen less frequently. I know cats only respond to positive reinforcement. What can I do to reward my brown cat when he acts civil to the other cat when they're in the same bedroom?

MLEcoupe,1471908225,4z3fln,13,False,3,"Hi! So my lovely kitty is your typical cat...but a terror at night.

Here's a little backstory: my cat is a female, long haired cat that's 8 years old. She was my aunt's cat before my aunt passed away and I've had her for 4 years. My aunt had her declawed in the front only.

Every night my cat is constantly messing with stuff in my room. Now, before you say, ""put her in a kennel or just shut the door,"" this cat is EXTREMELY vocal. My bedroom door is one of those fake wooden hollow doors, so when I do shut her out, she cries and paws at the door which is very loud. 

I've noticed she's that even though she's declawed, she still paws at everything, including my flat screen, box spring, and a canvas picture (that she has to get up on top of a piece of furniture to even reach). 

I'm running out of ideas. This happens every night and I'm exhausted. Here's what I've got/tried so far: 
-cat scratching post (in the living room)
-fed her soft food at night 
-spray bottle (she literally doesn't even care if she gets hit by it unless it's in her face)
-diffuse different ""calming"" essential oils
-placed bags and boxes in the living room to distract her
-yelled and clapped loudly while I'm half awake (it's a struggle)

I'm just not sure what to do or try anymore! Any cat training tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  ",CatTraining,My cat won't stop waking me up at night...tips please?!
YELOSUB18,1471903212,4z31ru,3,False,0,"BACKGROUND: My husband and I got our cat from the shelter about a year and a half ago. The shelter guessed he was about 4 years old. He was almost 16 lbs when we got him. Since we've had him, he hasn't gained anything, but also hasn't lost anything. The vet isn't too worried about his weight - he's really just a large cat to begin with - but said a diet of course wouldn't hurt.

CURRENT DIET: We've modified his food a few times over the past year and half to get him to lose weight, but so far nothing has worked. What we're currently doing, and the cat seems to like is: 
* 1 can of 5.5oz wet food a day, split into morning and dinner (Wegmans Buju &amp; Ziggie brand) 
* Constant bowl of water available 
* Dry food in a bowl. We only keep about a half cup of the dry food out at a time, or less. We only fill it when it's empty. Not sure of the exact brand, but it's meat based (none or very little corn meal).

THE PROBLEM: The cat will pee outside the litter box in protest of anything he doesn't like. If the box isn't clean enough for him, he pees outside. If we haven't given him enough attention, he pees outside. If we give him less food, he pees outside. If we change the type of litter or box, he pees outside. It took a while to adjust and find exactly what he likes, but we've finally gotten to an understanding between the cat and us and have minimized the frequency of the non-box pees.
We know they are protests. See the disclaimer below about the vet. Also, he had a toy with a ball in an outer ring that he had started peeing on. We didn't understand why. I joked that maybe he just wanted the ball to come out. So we took it out. He wouldn't stop playing with the ball and the peeing on the toy stopped.
Peeing outside the box means usually peeing on the bathroom rug (which is easy to throw in the wash, luckily), or a few of his favorite spots on the carpet in the living room. Occasionally, he's peed on clothes, shoes, or pillows on the floor, but that was usually early-on in our adjustments of each other. My husband and I are much more careful what is left on the floor! The cat will also poop outside the box if it's too dirty, but luckily it's on the bathroom floor, so I'd much rather clean that than pee on carpet. (He also doesn't cover his poop at all. He paws at the wall like he's covering it, but has no idea how to cover it.)

DISCLAIMERS: 
* We tried the Comfort Zone Felliway for about a month, but it didn't seem to make a difference.
* He was already front declawed and neutered when he came to the shelter. I've read that can affect their personality, but what was done is done. 
* Obviously, since he's front declawed, he's a strictly indoors cat. 
* When the non-box pee frequency picks up (ie: cleaning the box doesn't fix the problem), we've taken him to the vet to make sure he doesn't have any other issues. So far, they've found nothing. 
* We currently rent an apartment. The cat's already ruined the carpet in a few spots. We're planning on buying our first home in the next year and are worried what that might do to the cat. 
* The cat has two litter boxes - both open (he didn't seem to like covered). They're right next to each other in one of the bathrooms, but we also don't have a lot of options to spread them out in other parts of our 2BR/2BA apartment.

THE QUESTIONS: What's the best way for us to get the cat to lose weight, without risking too many ""pee-protests""? Should I try the Felliway for a longer time? Should I just get some puppy-pads, put them in his favorite pee spots, and prepare for the worst (especially before we buy a house)? Any other suggestions to minimize his litter-box protests?

gettinashes,1471289676,4xvcyr,2,False,6,"At least, that's my running theory. Here are her behaviours:

* Hisses at all the cats, all the time. Even when she's the one invading *their* space.
* I can't hand her food, even wet food that she loves. She tries to hide the food and then runs away. Will only eat when I'm not nearby.
* She'll jump up on the couch, but only if I'm asleep or perfectly still.
* When she wants to eat, she attempts to chase every other cat upstairs first.
* Oddly, she *will* sprint over to say hi to humans and demand petting... **only IF** we are trying to use the restroom.
* Pees **in** the litterboxes, but exclusively poops **next** to the litterboxes. Even when the box was just cleaned out.

I suspect that some of her stress is due to having been declawed by her previous owners. Can't do much about that.

Basically she seems insane and I'm not sure there's any way I can help her, lol. It's not a big deal currently, but I'm mildly concerned because we have a 14 year old cat and he will have a harder time to defend himself as he ages.

About 3 weeks ago, I was beginning the moving process from one apartment to another. This is the 2nd time I've moved with him, with the last being in January. I transferred some major things to the new place right before I went on a weekend trip out of town, and returned to find that he had peed in multiple places around my old apartment - specifically in the closet around his litter box. 

I've left him home alone plenty of times before, at worst resulting in him tearing up some insignificant paper or knocking a few objects down while I'm gone.

A day or so after moving to the new place completely, he peed on the carpet near me where I could clearly see him. I caught him in the act and put him in time out/sprayed him with water. I cleaned up the spot as best I could.

I left town by surprise again a couple of weekends later, and he pooped in that same place, then peed in 2 spots on my clothes (they were laying on the floor).

Today he pooped on the floor while I was at work - hadn't even been gone that long. His litter box is as clean as it has ever been, and he seems 100% comfortable in the new home in all other ways.

While this is an inconvenience, it's somewhat understandable that he's stressed by the change in schedule. Well, since last weekend he has not pooped in the litter box. I work close to home so often come home for lunch, but there are days when I need to work through lunch and am unable to come home. My two dogs don't have an issue with being inside for 8 hours but all this week I've come home to a pile of poop 3 feet from the litter box. He still pees in the box, however. This morning, I woke up to poop outside the box. I wasn't even gone, I was home all night. He just doesn't poop in the litter box anymore apparently.

There is not a problem with cleanliness of the box; I dumped all the litter and replaced it with fresh. He also still had both litter boxes out. I recently put away the second litter box since that was the only thing that changed, still pooped on floor. I have a Feliway diffuser on its way to see if that helps (not sure what the community's opinion of those are, it was suggested by the rescue group). I could try switching the litter but I really dislike the dust/smell of clay litters and doubt that's the issue because he still pees there and had no issue until I went away.

I'm really exasperated and at a loss! It's one thing for him to be stressed about me going away all weekend, but what's the deal with pooping on the floor overnight or while I'm just at work? What do I do if he can't be unsupervised without pooping outside the box for less than 8 hours? Thanks for any advice you can offer.

bowsywowsy,1461351004,4fzwbf,1,False,5,"Hi all, I desperately need help with my cat who has Pica and is sensitive.

**Background:**

2 year old female Tabby. 6 lbs. No medication. No health issues. Indoor only.
Current food: Blue Buffalo Indoor Health
Vet visit scheduled to check for hypothyroidism

2 years ago my husband and I rescued an 8 week female kitten from Craigslist. Super cute, cuddly and friendly kitten. I met the mom and all her litter mates. We already had a cat and dog in the household and followed all the steps to a friendly introduction. Because of that they all get a long great, she especially loves the dog. 

At about 6-8 months old we noticed chewing behaviors. Wires were being destroyed and cardboard boxes were chewed on the edges. We sprayed the wires with BitterApple, then promptly bought CritterCord and electrical protectors. I researched this online and it said it normally resolves itself at 2 years of age and to keep the cat away from the stimulus.

Things have only been going downhill from there. She has only increased her chewing/eating behaviors. Now baskets, pieces of string, tinsel and even thick wires (vacuum cords) which we thought were safe, are being chewed and sometimes eaten. Cardboard scratchers are being torn apart completely. It is impossible to protect her from everything she could possibly ingest.

In addition, she has also become a very sensitive cat. She scurries from any loud sound and hides when anyone comes in the door, including us. We travelled in December and were gone for a week. A friend came fed the cats and cleaned the litterboxes every other day. When we returned home, the bedroom carpet was soaked in pee. We did some investigating and noticed she was peeing in other spots in the house too. I surmised this was a UTI and the vet confirmed it. She recovered well, but by then had behaviorally become accustomed to peeing in certain locations. We corralled these off and bought a cat cage (which we gently accustomed her to) to keep her in a night so we could keep the bedroom door open and not have her go in. She has returned to peeing in the litterbox, but the carpet  is so bad, it will have to be replaced and I no longer trust her. 

We are a military family and will be required to move every 3 years (if not less) for many years to come. We also travel at LEAST once a month. I am very worried because she is so sensitive to stress that every move and every time we travel will cause her to develop a UTI and further her Pica.

**Potential Solutions:**

I am trying to convert her to an outdoor cat, but she has grown up loving dogs (I have fostered many a puppies and dogs that she loves to lay with) and I am scared they will end up killing her. She also has 0 experience with being outdoors. This does not seem like a responsible way to take care of the issue.

I would love to rehome her to a quiet place, BUT she has Pica.  I cannot think of anyone who would want a cat like this and I will not lie about her problems to get rid of her.

RN_Mindbender,1460568736,4emniy,7,False,3,"My wife and I are extremely sleep deprived. We have an 8-month-old that we're trying to train how to sleep. Even when our baby is down, we're struggling to get sleep as it is. (Knowing crying could shatter your ears at any moment makes it tough to sleep.)

However, one of the biggest issues that's coming up is the fact that our cats are jerks. (They're actually very sweet, but I'm frustrated.)

We have a small two bedroom house with all wood floors. When our baby goes to sleep in her nursery, we close the doors. The cats generally respect that door. However, when we close our door for the night with them outside, they will relentlessly claw at our door which is actually quite loud and annoying as heck.

Now, we'd let them sleep in our room, however there are two issues that make that now impossible:
1. They like to sleep on our bed which makes it hard to stretch out your legs.
2. They get frisky and night and like to run in and out of our room. Also, they make a fair amount of noise in our living room (jumping down from counters on the wood floor, scratching/cleaning the litterbox). If we don't close the door, we hear it all.

So, my question is does anybody have any great ways to keep them from scratching the doors?

I've tried the following:

-Barricading the door. This tends to work, but if I don't do it right, they end up getting through to the door. This means I have to pile a ton of stuff in front of the door. But when the baby cries or we have to use the bathroom, it's totally impossible. So this won't work.
-Putting cardboard with super sticky tape on the ground outside the door. This works okay as a deterrent at first, but they eventually just go to the side of the board and lift it up to get at the door. They're too smart. 
-Putting the above cardboard upright against the door and tack it to the door so it goes up about two feet high. They just go to the side and lift up a flap and scratch at the door.
-Putting the vacuum cleaner in front of the door. They are scared of the vacuum, but only when it's on.

Anybody else found a solution that might work? We're so desperate to find a way to coexist at night. My wife is at the point where she's tempted to just put them outside.

apley,1460337140,4e8jx9,2,False,6,"Hi there,

Shorter version of my question:

Just adopted a young male cat as a companion for my 8yo male cat who was lonely after our older female cat got cancer and had to be put down (side note: they never really liked eachother). The new kitty is super duper hyper at all times when he's awake, and is the stereotypical little brother (not touching you not touching you). Loves to stalk/pounce, jump on the older cat, which has in the last couple days evolved into straight up wrestling. At what point is the wrestling too far? Should I let them have at it? Are they just playing?

The cats (the longer explanation):

Marley is 8, has always been timid/a fraidy cat. Loves a select few people and totally afraid of strangers. Hes the type of cat that takes off under the bed when the doorbell rings. Otherwise he's a great cat - can do tricks, loves a regular schedule, total mama's boy, usually very well behaved. Has been kinda down in the dumps since our other cat got sick and had to be put down all of a sudden before christmas, although they were never really close (he chased her around now and then). He's been lazy and putting on weight (he's a big cat anyways) and very clingy so we decided it was time to get him a friend.

Tater is about 7 months - a stray from our city's humane services. At the shelter he was calm, quiet, and napping each time we visited. They told us he was good with other cats and he had made plenty of friends in his time there (there were others sharing the same room with him). We got him home and he immediately was friendly and cuddly and sweet. He had to be kept separate for 12 days because of cat flu, and after his meds were done we could slowly introduce them. In his time in quarantine he was very busy, pulling random items off the bookshelf to play with, being a little poke, getting into kitten trouble, nothing unexpected.

When we started introducing them (through cracks in the door, one in a kennel, etc) there was the expected little bit of hissing, growling etc, but nothing too aggressive. We eventually let them out and it was actually going well. Once Tater got comfortable (Marley was still timid/suspicious of him at this point) he loved chasing Marley around/up the stairs, etc. They've eaten meals next to each other, been in the same room with no major chaos.

The past week or so Tater has taken to stalking Marley, swatting him in the face, jumping on him from around the corner. We've taken this as his kitten playfulness and not thought too much of it, given them breaks and time alone with us, and tried to play with Tater as much as possible to get out his hyper hyper kitten energy. When he gets cornered, Marley will growl or hiss at Tater as a warning, and may swat back, but not usually - he's been very patient. His go-to is usually hide away in a box or up on furniture away from Tater. The last couple days this has escalated to straight up wrestling, both of them trying to bite each others throats, kicking, etc. No hissing, growling, nobody fluffed up, no real signs of serious aggression, but the wrestling is VERY VERY rough, I have seen few small tufts of fur go flying.

TL;DR: We just want them to get along, and if this is just playing thats ok, but I worry that the older cat is frustrated and doesnt want to play and is constantly being pestered by the younger cat. How do we tell if the wrestling is too aggressive and going beyond play or if one isn't having fun anymore?

Long-term goal is to have them together all day while we're at work or out of the house and not worry that they'll clobber each other. What steps should we take to help them get along? Will Tater grow out of being so hyper? Can't we all just get along and lick each other's fur??",CatTraining,"Help! Cat wrestling, pouncing, etc with newly introduced cat.

I'm currently living with a guy who is pretty cool, but I'm convinced has the meanest cat ever. He's lived with this cat for four years, and in that time the cat has actually fought with another cat he tried to adopt so much that he had to give the adoptive cat to another home. I've never had any experience training cats at all, so I'm really out of my depth here (having only ever had dogs of my own). I strongly doubt that given my experience that I'll ever really be a cat person, but I'm hoping that you guys might have some insight for me. The situation is as follows:

Come home, attacked and hissed at by cat. Walk into living room, hissed at and attacked by cat. Climb stairs to my room, attacked by and hissed at by cat... etc. This cat attacks and hisses at me almost every step that I take in this house. The rent is too cheap for me to pass up, and I can't really go anywhere else.

Nena our ~4 year old resident cat is absolutely terrified of her (and basically everything else). 

Both cats are beta so I don't think its a territory thing, but whenever Nena sees Mouse shes hisses and runs away. 

Here is the kicker though. Nena doesn't really like food or treats. Shes a very picky eater to begin with, and very rarely eats anything other than her wet food, and even then only eats small portions. 

So our problem is we aren't sure how to train her to see that Mouse just wants to be her cuddle buddy, since she doesn't really enjoy treats or food.

We have only had Mouse for 4 days. I know it will take way more time, but we are trying to think ahead to train the right habits earlier rather than later. 

Nena has the run of the house. Has plenty of places to hide and climb. We have been room swapping Mouse and Nena to get them used to each others scents. Tried rubbing them with the same towel, but Nena was having none of that. 

The odd thing is Nena is curious. She'll approach the door to Mouse room and sniff around while her tail is whipping around at a million miles an hour. Last night she even came into Mouse's room while I left the door open to sniff around, but when she saw Mouse all bundled up in a blanket she hissed at her and ran.

Beartow,1445889744,3qbnsc,2,False,4,"Hi all, 

I took in a cat about two months ago that had been living in the garden when we moved in. My landlord said he belonged to the lady who lived here before us, and she just left him behind when she moved. I got him fixed and brought him in, and in general he's a pretty cool guy. He's awful with food though - constantly begging, trying to eat off people's plates, and ripping open the packaging of anything we leave out. He'll eat bread, bagels, pasta - whatever he finds, he'll eat it. Today was the last straw for me, he crept behind me and swiped a whole doughnut from my hand and ran off with it before starting to eat it as quickly as possible. He also went through a phase of going through neighbours' bins and eating rotten food, which he ended up getting pretty sick from. 

How do we stop this? We feed him twice a day at regular times, and signal it's dinner time. When he tries getting at our food while we're eating he's clapped at, put outside, and ignored for a while. He improved a little bit for a while, but recently went right back to swiping whatever he can get his paws on. He usually finishes his bowl as soon as we put it down, but it's a normal amount for his age (the vet said he's somewhere between one and two years old). I'm guessing while being abandoned and living outside he got used to not knowing where his next meal was coming from, since as far as I can tell no one else in the street was feeding him, and he was in a rough state when we took him in.

arbloch,1444961834,3oxt2y,5,False,4,"Hey all! We just adopted a ""Level 2"" cat from the ASPCA. He's 1.5yo and very friendly, but we're having some issues. From our understanding, he's ""Level 2"" because he was returned twice. Once for a dumb reason (returned after one night because he kept the owners from sleeping) and the other time because the owner declared he had ""food psychosis"" and was causing too much trouble.

We have three rooms in the apartment. Whenever he's in the kitchen/living room, pretty much all he wants to do is jump on the counter near the stovetop. We've tried a few things: gently shoving him off (worthless), tin foil barriers (slowed him down but ultimately worthless), and today we started locking him in the bedroom alone for five minutes every time he jumped up. 

It was pretty frustrating getting up literally dozens of times to remove him, so we probably started getting a little scarier than we should have been. We never hit him or anything but we were pretty imposing and he seems to resent it. A few times he's swatted at our legs angrily when we stand near him and he's near the counter, and he just bit my girlfriend when she tried to reward him for going elsewhere in the room (for once).

Tomorrow is day 3 with our new cat. I don't want to foster lasting hostility with the new cat, but we both work hard and we can't spend every evening removing our cat from the counter over and over again and trying to keep our patience. 

I'm also worried that locking him in the bedroom isn't really sending the right message. For one, we want the bedroom to be a place he likes. His bed, litterbox, and food are here. So far he does seem to like it. That leads to my second concern. He doesn't meow or anything when he's in here, and after we let him out, it doesn't seem to discourage him from repeating the behavior even a little bit. He doesn't hesitate one second longer to go immediately to the counter. He doesn't seem to be learning much.

We really don't have a lot of rules. Having our cat on the counter where we prepare food is pretty much the only one. If we can fix that, I think we're golden. How can we do it?",CatTraining,Training cat to stay off counter

PantsAtWork,1444319732,3nzhih,5,False,5,"Some background information: my fiance and I have a three year old fixed male cat and we have never, ever had any potty problems with him. He uses his litterbox no problem, unless I get a little lazy with cleaning it and then he'll poop on the floor, but pees are always in the litter. 

Back in June we took in a stray kitten. In the beginning we kept her locked in our master bathroom because we wanted to keep Tito safe from any FELV or FIV she might be carrying since she was a stray. She had a litter box in the bathroom and used it no problem. I noticed she would sometimes pee in the shower, right over the drain, and I thought she was so smart because the pee just disappeared! We released her into the general population (the other cat + two dogs) in July and we moved the second litter box upstairs where the first box is - there's really just no room for it in our bathroom. She has still been using it like a champ - no stray poops and I haven't found any pees in any piles of clothing, in any closets, on the guest bed, no where. About a week ago, we got home from a night out and got into bed, and there was cat pee in the bed. Right in the middle. The bed wasn't made, so the pee went right onto the mattress. We washed the sheets, the comforter, and I used probably a half-bottle of Nature's Miracle on the mattress to get rid of the smell. We had locked the kitten back in the bedroom for a very short period of time earlier that day because the dogs were being crazy, and I just assumed we locked her in at the wrong time and it was our fault (although she could have just used the shower like she used to, but I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt). We cleaned up, moved on, and had a clean bed. This morning, we woke up, and we're cuddling the kitten. She usually sleeps on the bed with us and will wake me up nightly kneading my arm and wanting pets, then she's always there in the morning to get cuddles. I got up to get ready for work, but my fiance came in bed, and I just hear him say, ""Um, what is that?"" I came out and sure enough there's a damp spot on our comforter - probably half dry - and I smell it and it's pee again! She peed on the bed while the three of us were sleeping in it! I just can't figure out in my mind why she would do that! She's not neurotic at all - no anxiety, no hiding, nothing. She doesn't pee on anything else.

Here's what we've done so far: We've kept them separated for the past week. We've allowed NK to explore the home with RK are in a closed off room. We've fed everyone on either side of the door. We've tried to exchange scents via lots of petting. We've allowed glimpses through 1"" wide gap in door. 

Yesterday one RK was put on our porch so she could see (but not likely smell well though) while we allowed NK to meet the other RK. RK was very well behaved. She hissed, but didn't go Halloween-y, growl, strike out or anything like that. NK didn't say anything at all. They followed me around. I spent time praising RK and petting her, and doing the same with NK. RK kept her eye on NK but was very calm for the most part. However, the moment RK turned her back on NK he charged her and she raced to her safe spot under our bed (she is definitely a flight, not fight, kitty). 

So, questions: 

1) I'm worried that NK will just look to pounce whenever he can, meaning no one can relax (including me). Is there anything I can do about this behavior? 

2) RK #2 (who was on the porch) is definitely a fight kitty, not flight, which is why I held off doing a nose:nose intro as I'm not certain it would go well yet. How long should I wait to nose:nose intro them? 

How long does this process generally take? I had high hopes when RK#1 didn't do anything but some hissing, but NK's charge &amp; attack makes me worried. I also want to eliminate as much potential for injury as possible.

lameofdrones,1440523090,3icu2i,0,False,1,"My girlfriend has two cats that she has been away from for almost two years. They were kept by her friend when she left her old city. Now, we have established a relationship and we have moved in to the same place. I have a 3 year old female Russian Blue named Marzipan and she has two American Shorthairs - Mojo (male, 5) and Jim (male, 9). 

We just went and got these cats from 3.5 hours away and brought them to my house. 2 days ago. Currently they are separated by a door. We feed them on opposite sides of the door and it doesn't really seem to get in the way of them eating. None of the cats seem preoccupied by the presence of the other cats.

Marzipan is a very territorial cats and likes to be in control. She likes to dominate the other cats. She has been with other cats in the past, but she always wants to make them hide from her. In my last relationship my ex and I had a cat named Marmalade. She was the resident cat when we first got Marzipan. We lived in a very big house, so we just brought her home from the vet and let them figure it out. I didn't have any idea that you needed to acclimate them to each other's smells. So... Marzipan quickly became the leader of the pack - chasing Marmalade to the basement and Marzipan did a pretty good job at keeping her out of the way.

When that relationship ended I grabbed Marzipan and went back to my folks house. They have two cats - Boots (female, 8) and Gizmo (male, 8). At first we tried to just let them figure it out, but soon the relationship between Boots and Marzipan would forever ruined. Boots and Marzipan would grown and hiss and even attack each other. When they cut each other pretty bad (Marzipan got a big cut on her stomach and chewed off nearly all of her hair in attempts to clean it. Boots lost an entire claw.) 

Occasionally, Marzipan will get downstairs (I rent the top portion of my parents rental.) and Boots and her will growl, but they pretty much stay out of each other's way. Gizmo has never really had too much of a problem with Marzipan, but he does hiss at her (I think because Boots does).

So... when we brought Mojo and Jim to my home we let them walk around and sure enough Marzipan got pissed. I looked online and found that the best thing to do is not let them see each other - just let them smell each others fur and scents. They are currently separated by a door, but that just changed. There was a baby gate that separated them, but Marzipan just wants to sit by it and hiss at the other cats and scare them. Mojo isn't so afraid of Marzipan, but Jim runs and hides a lot. Jim and Mojo have lived together for about 5 years. They know each other. I don't know exactly what there relationship was like before, but they at least would lay together. They seem to be doing fine behind the door, but when Mojo does see Marzipan he starts to take out his frustration on Jim.

We feed them on opposite sides of the door. Jim and Mojo on one side and Marzipan on the other. The food dish can be butted up right against the door and they will eat there food, but when we opened the door and put the baby gate down they seem to preoccupied with one another to be able to eat.

When Marzipan was in the room Mojo and Jim had free reign of the house. For the most part they would stay away from the door and didn't really seem to interested in Marzipan. Marzipan, on the other hand is constantly watching for the other cats. When Marzipan and the other cats switched spots Mojo and Jim would find a place to hide - outside of the view of Marzipan and Marzipan would just sit by the gate. Marzipan had the whole upstairs, but just wanted to sit and hiss.

So... I closed the doors again.

**Is Marzipan extra worried about the cats because there are two of them?** this is only the second day that the cats have been around each other. I probably pushed the visual introduction a little fast because they didn't seem to have a problem being on opposite sides of the doors.

Hello. My cat has developed the tendency to pee right outside the litter box, or on rugs that are close by.

The normal behavior is for him to sit on the bathroom counter by the sink and meow.  It doesn't matter if there's already water in the sink.  If I don't get up, he will jump up on the bed and meow in my face.

the younger one (tabby) is much more nervous. she will come to me if i have food, and is slowly learning a few things from clicker training, but is generally harder to keep engaged. she does love to be pet, but only when i'm sitting/ lying down. she will come to me and spend half an hour purring on my leg. she's also fine to be picked up if she's come to me first. she won't, however, come close to me when i'm standing, unless by accident while playing, and if anyone but the other kitten approaches her she will dart a few feet away or underneath something. it seems as if the combination of height/ the possibility of being picked up are really scary to her. she and tuxedo love each other lots and play nicely, it's only me/other people that she hides from. 

my question is, how can i get her to relax when she's being approached? i thought about holding her for a few seconds every day and giving her a treat at the same time, but that would require chasing her down first and i don't want to scare her. plus, she doesn't seem to mind the holding itself, just the approach.

I have a cat at home, british shorthair, cca 2 years old. He's with us since he was 2 weeks I believe.
He's a beautiful looking cat (big, not fat, typical british shorthair features), but I think I kinda screwed up his training. Or maybe the problem is, he didn't have any training at all, since I believed that cat are not mostly trained.

The problem is, he is scared of touch. It depends on his mood, you can usually pet him but taking him in arms is a big nope, unless he's sleepy. He also has tendencies to bite / attack my hands (not viciously, though it sometimes get's a little too much).

For some reason he's really mean to my mom, like hissing at her, biting her, doesn't trust her at all. He trusts me more, lies in my vicinity, let himself pet (but still no taking in arms).
I don't think that me or my mom gave him any reason to be scared / aggresive. He always has food (good stuff), water, toys (in which he's not interested at...). He's an only animal in the flat. Is there any way to make him less scared / aggresive? Isn't he too old for any training? Me might have just spoiled him, don't know...

thekiyote,1437768648,3ehgk6,0,False,2,"_I'm currently working on a new ebook for cat training that is attempting to take the science of behavioral training and applying it to cats, going into much more detail than what's been previously published._

_This is a rough draft of the section on using LMS to stop unwanted behaviors._

_Comments, critiques, and criticisms are all welcome!_

----
**Least Reinforcing Stimulus**

If you want to stop a behavior, for example, your cat scratching your couch instead of his scratching post, you need to change things up so you are no longer reinforcing the behavior.  The easiest way to stop a behavior is to find a new behavior that is a stronger reinforcer than the behavior than the behavior you are trying to extinguish.  In this instance, you might put a scratching post in the living room and bridge (click) him whenever you see him scratch the post, until the original behavior of scratching the couch is extinguished.  

However, there isn‚Äôt always a replacement behavior readily available.  Since we want to avoid negative reinforcement when at all possible, we will need to use a technique called the **Least Reinforcing Stimulus (LMS)**.  A LMS is a return to a neutral state, usually a very short time out where you don‚Äôt engage or react to your cat for 3-5 seconds. [These pauses are most effective when kept short.  You want your cat to be able to offer a new substitute behavior which can be rewarded, either through a bridge, when working on a trick, or affection if you‚Äôre trying to change a more general behavior.]  

If your cat is behaving in a way that isn‚Äôt easily ignored, you may have to physically move your cat for the time out, first a few feet away, and, if that isn‚Äôt effective, into another room.  But even in these situations, the LMS shouldn‚Äôt last longer than a couple of minutes.  

Least Reinforcing Stimuli are very effective in correcting behaviors, but they can sometimes trip up owners when used incorrectly.  For example, a while ago, my cat Puck had picked up the behavior of playing too aggressively with my girlfriend, Vickie.  He would attempt to solicit play from her by biting, not enough to inflict injury, but enough to cause pain.  Eventually, the problem became so bad that Vickie was constantly paranoid that Puck would start attacking her again.  She would keep toys around to throw to him if he started attacking her, but this just reinforced the behavior with play time.

It was around this time that I suggested that she try LMS and give him short timeouts whenever he started to attack her.  She was afraid of him attacking her, so instead, she would hop around, flailing until I put a stop to it.  Puck quickly developed a new behavior:  he would stop attacking Vickie when I entered the room (but not before).  I became ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, but the second I left the room, he would start attacking her again

At this point, she understood that if she wanted Puck to stop attacking her, she needed to be the one to administer the LMS.  She did this for a couple of weeks, but there wasn‚Äôt much improvement.  Since there should have been improvement by now, I decided to follow her and see what was going on for myself.  What I saw was that when she picked Puck up, she would coo to him, saying ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs a bad little kitty getting a timeout for attacking me?‚Äù 

When asked why she would do that, she would respond, ‚ÄúHe just looks so sad in time out, I just wanted to make him feel better.‚Äù  

LMS shouldn‚Äôt be a punishment, it is a return to a neutral state, but you should also be aware of any unintended positive reinforcements.  By anthropomorphising Puck, Vickie was positively reinforcing his aggression.  It‚Äôs important to remember that your cat doesn‚Äôt understand words, and needs to develop an association through your actions.  Puck just understood the affection, which led to a false association. 

Once corrected, Puck didn‚Äôt need other room timeouts within a couple of days, and the aggressive behavior was completely extinguished within two weeks.",CatTraining,Stopping Unwanted Behaviors With Least Reinforcing Stimulus (ebook excerpt)

I adopted my cat a few years ago from a friend who's old cat wouldn't let her eat or use the litter box. When I first got her I had to bring her to the vet to get ear mites and crystals in her bladder remedied. Six ish to a year after that I brought her back for crystals again. I had her on blue buffalo chicken and sweet potato dry food. Currently she is on vet provoded bladder wet and dry (so she free feeds on dry and I give her wet in the morning and night). 

She for the most part hasn't had an issue, but it seems to flare every so often. A few months ago a friend came to play pinball. She jumped up and was watching, he didn't like that so he was shooing her off to another but she miss stepped and fell ( on her feet) ran off. I followed her and she was peeing in the corner, then as I was cleaning that up, she pooped near the shoes up stairs ( a place she poops a lot). She pooped there a few more times randomly that week. I brought her to the vet, she checked out fine, besides being a huge hissing cat. I got feliway plug ins. Seemed to help for a month, it is still plugged in ( new liquid bottle though)

My SO and I left this past weekend, Friday evening to Sunday afternoon. I have left her before for that long no issue. We get home and she left poop at the front door. That night she pooped down stairs. Then just tonight I caught her in the act pooping again downstairs. I picked her up and put her in her litter box.

Our male cat Linus is obsessed with outside. He tries everything he can possibly think of to get us to take him outside. This obsession drives all of his bad behavior. When we take him out to the backyard, all of his bad behavior disappears for a short period, but once back inside, he's the same old bad-behaved cat. 

Sure, he has his cute moments (he likes to knead himself to sleep with one of my wife's sweaters that he's had since he was a kitten). He can also be a cuddly cat when he's in the mood, but the majority of his time is spent thinking about how he can get back outside. He's escaped a couple times by clawing through the screen door. 

He's always been like this, ever since we got him at 7 weeks. I don't think he was meant to be an indoor only cat and our current living situation does not allow him to be an indoor-outdoor cat (We live in the city, near a lot of heavy-traffic roads - I've seen cat roadkill a few times on my morning commute).

We're thinking he needs to be an indoor-outdoor cat. He would definitely be a happy well-behaved cat if he could come and go as he pleases. 

One problem with re-homing him is our female cat Zevy is very attached to Linus and it would be traumatic for her were he to leave. We're thinking we would find another cat with a similar temperament to hers and introduce her to a new friend. We're just not sure when the best time is to make that transition.

[deleted],1428378567,31pkr7,1,False,2,"So I have been thinking lately of getting 2 cats, the reason for 2 is that I think they would have more fun in general if they were 2. My family had 2 cats before but one at a time and it just felt like it would have been better with 2.

Anyway a few questions:

1. Is it bad with 2 cats? My thought process is that the only bad things are that it will cost more with food and care, as well as more cleaning. And the rest feels mostly positive? The cats will be able to be together so it won't be bored out of my mind if I'm busy doing something else and really wants to play for example? Is there any more downsides to having 2 cats versus 1?

2. How do I show the cats they are doing something wrong? A problem we had with one of our previous cats were that he bit people a lot when he played. How do I train a cat for example not to do that? As I read a lot that punishment doesn't work well, but it feels difficult that he would learn not to do it from positive clicker training or so?

3. Is it bad to let cats chase your hands? Should I let them only hunt/chase toys? One of the reasons for my previous cat to bite people is probably because he got taught to chase/hunt hands for fun. And I guess this is something I shouldn't do? Or does this not matter?

4. How often should I check the health of the cats with a vet? Only when it seems something is wrong, every year or every 6 months etc?

5. If I get 2 cats, is there a specific ""combo"" that works best? 2 females or 2 males etc?

6. Is there any issue having different breeds of cats together or does it not matter at all? Maybe a stupid question but I don't know the answer so would be nice to know:)

7. How should I treat them in the future? This maybe sounds stupid as well but if I for example teach a cat to come to me when I call it's name by giving it a treat everytime it does this. When he finally does it all the time, should I still give him a treat every time I call his name? Or that he does the specific thing. Or can I give a treat occasionally when he does the good thing?

BlueCthulhu,1427404680,30f3bc,0,False,2,"So I'll start by giving some background on our cats:

Meemee: Older Manx cat, about three years old. We found her as a stray  kitten and have reason to believe she was abused/had a rough kittenhood. Doesn't like to be pet very often and when she does it's only for a short period until she'll start scratching and biting. Otherwise she's a good cat with a calm temperament.  

Bibi: Younger Scottish Fold cat, adopted from local cat rescue when she was abut 4 months old. Great personality, very affectionate. 

My SO and I adopted Bibi in November 2014 and she and Meemee didn't get along very well. We kept Bibi in a separate bedroom for about a week and slowly introduced her to the house. When we started to introduce the two cats, we kept Bibi in a carrier and let Meemee check her out from the carrier. After a day or two of this, we opened the carrier door and let them interact more closely. Meemee would hide from Bibi when she was out of the carrier. She kept hidden for a week or two and slowly started coming out. The two cats had a slightly rocky beginning together but now they will share a room without too much of a problem. 

This is where the ""passive-aggressiveness"" comes in. Meemee will share a room with Bibi but about half the time she will growl and hiss and sometimes attack Bibi if she comes too close. Bibi is happy-go-lucky and will acknowledge Meemee's attitude by stepping away but won't fight or hiss back. Usually these spats end with Meemee chasing Bibi from the room or Meemee running out of the room. 

This behavior doesn't happen all the time though. On a daily basis we'll see the two cats playing together and grooming each other like they're the best of friends. So I don't really know what to do about this aggressive behavior from Meemee. We've tried using a spray bottle when she starts growling, which will help for the short term but we'll catch her growling at Bibi again not too long after. The cats do share a litterbox (large multi-cat box) and food and water. I've tried putting up another litterbox for about two weeks and this did nothing, and I've also tried putting their food in separate dishes (the main food dish is a self-filling hopper), and so far that hasn't worked. I'm feeling like Meemee is threatened by Bibi in some way and is still feeling like her territory is being encroached instead of being able to share it.
So my question is, how can we train Meemee into having a better relationship with our new cat? 

**TL;DR** Older cat will be aggressive to our younger cat, then play with her. How do we train her to get along with the younger cat?

[deleted],1426743866,2zk3h0,4,False,3,"We just recently moved a few weeks ago, and now our 2yr old cat won't stop peeing and pooping all over the house (though she favors a few spots). We've never had potty issues with her before, so I'm a little lost on what to do. She took to the litter box very naturally as a kitten, when she was an indoor-only cat. No real issues. When she was a little under a year, we moved from a 2nd story apartment to a house with a yard, and she became an indoor/outdoor cat. Since then, she hardly EVER uses her litter box anymore, she just does her business outside. But on the rare occasion she went inside, she still used the litter box. It worked well for all of us.

But now, since we moved 3 weeks ago (to another house with a yard), all that is out the window. We kept her inside for a week and a half to get acclimated to the new house. We expected *a few* potty issues. She used the litter box fine for the first few days, but then started choosing the bathroom rugs, as well as various spots on the carpet in our 2 spare bedrooms. Even when we keep her litter box immaculately clean.

We started letting her outside again, and she's in and out throughout the day and evening. But it seems as if she would rather hold it in while outside, wait til she gets *inside*, and use the rug instead. Why is she doing this, and how do we correct it?",CatTraining,Cat forgot everything she knew about where to use the bathroom

Very loving and affectionate, plays with the dog, no major complaints. Well, other than the fact that he chooses to pee wherever he pleases. I got us a breeze system cause my family used it in the past and I LOVE not having to step on litter all the time. The cat will poop in there all day, but he will only pee in there every now and again it seems. Last night he peed in the box (pad was about 3 days old, used it a few times) and this morning he peed on the carpet. I have put some litter into the pad so he can smell that familiar scent, but it doesn‚Äôt seemed to have helped any. He gets neutered at the end of the month, and I am hoping that this may just be a marking his territory kind of thing? I am seriously at a loss for what I should do?

I have three cats, two girls and a boy, all fixed.  My male started peeing everywhere a couple of months ago.  We took him to the vet, found out he had a urinary tract infection, got the antibiotics and thought we solved the problem.  Then about 2 weeks ago he peed on the kitchen floor.  My husband very inappropriately yelled at him and he freaked out, peed again on the floor in front of us.  I got an extra litter box and switched litters, didn't help.  Then I caught one of my other cats chasing the boy away from the rooms where the boxes are...  Is it possible she's bullying him into not using the litter box?  She and my other female have also been fighting a lot recently. 

I don't know what to do.  I've started locking up the trouble maker for a couple hours at night to give him a chance to use the litter box, but he still isn't acting normal.  He used to be very shy but now he's constantly trying to get my attention.  And no matter how much time I spend cuddling him and playing with him he just keeps crying and smacking me with his paw until I ignore him long enough.  This is a nightly routine now.  And the bully is really making a nuisance of herself with the other cats even though she's always sweet to us.   They all go to the vet regularly so I know she has nothing physically wrong with her. My husband wants to keep her in one room but I don't feel like that's really a solution.

WickedVocalist,1423701235,2vljxt,1,False,2,"We adopted a kitten recently. He is teething. He came from a home who re-homed him to us due to allergy.

We have discovered that though he is very affectionate and needy, constantly purring and sweet as can be when he's purring, kneading, and suckling our blankets, that he is quite the biter.

He seems to bite out of nowhere, he bites hard, and goes straight for the face.. He has not drawn any blood or left marks but it hurts really bad and he prefers to bite us in the face while we are asleep!

Having a high maintenance kitten is more difficult that we expected. He is about 12 weeks and the vet won't neuter him until 5-6 months.

What should I do to train our kitten to not ever bite?

It seems we are wetting him down with the spray bottle over 50% of our day and wonder if this is just because he is teething.

I let it go, told my husbamd to be a little more dilagent about keeping the litter box clean (I'm pregnant)and so far he has but yesterday she peed on my bed and on the couch twice today...then she pooped on my bed earlier this evening... my husband is livid and wants the problem corrected asap. 
The first thing we did was clean the box out completely and try to re establish where she goes to the bathroom... as in maybe she didnt like the location of the box?

Nedd_,1418698864,2pfghk,4,False,2,"A few months ago I rescued a kitten from the streets. The vet told me she was around 2-3 months by the time, and now I suppose she's around  6-7 months! She's super sweet, likes playing and is great company.

Now, a week or so ago I adopted a barely-3-month old kitten. When I got home with her, there was a bunch of awkward behaviour by both parts, including very agressive hissing. I've followed a few steps of how to introduce kittens to adult cats I've seen on some websites, and it didn't go too bad.

I set up a ""safe room"" for the kitten where it stays for majority of the time, started off with scent exchanging with towels, socks, then swapped their rooms for a bit a few times per day. In a couple days they were both comfortable enough to eat side by side with the door closed and even cracked open (though the young cat would frequently stop her meal time to stare at the kitten).

The hissing has pratically stopped at this point, and I think they actually enjoy spending time together. The problem is that the cat chases the kitten a bit too hard, they bite and paw each other as they run around behind furniture. The kitten taunts the cat a lot, but when they're playing, oftenly the kitten cries out a bit (I believe from the cat biting her too harshly) and now I'm not sure if they're hurting each other. How do I know they're being friendly or aggressive? These are my first cats, and they get along with the dogs.

They're exclusive indoors, and I've never ever trained an animal, so I'm not always sure of what to do. I've managed to teach the cat that she can't go to some places, or that she's not supposed to chew on a few stuff, but I think this is beyond my knowledge!

He's about a year and a half, and he gets very energetic during the morning and night.  I feel bad that I live in a small condo and there isn't a whole lot of exploring he can do.  I got him a kitty condo for climbing which he loves.

Usually when he's all amped up, he runs around and gets into stuff he knows he's not supposed to (chewing electric cords, attacking the blinds, clawing at the carpet, etc.).  I'll look at him and give him a sharp ""NO"".  This is when it gets interesting...

He'll look at me, and I'll maintain eye contact.  He'll try to stair me down.  If I don't look away, he'll approach me and continue to stare, like he's challenging me.  If I don't back down, he'll full on jump at me.  Now, I know full well if he wanted to really hurt me he could.  He claws a bites, but never hard enough to break the skin.

[deleted],1413506017,2jgzvv,1,False,1,"We don't actually have a cat but my next-door-neighbour's cat, Fluffy, has adopted us. She greets us when we get home and will spend all her time with us when we are at home so she is practically our cat. Fluffy has been fixed so she isn‚Äôt on heat.


Soon after she began favouring our company two other cats have been prowling our premises - the Grey Cat, and the Big Fat Cat. Fluffy is not a fighter and hides from them. She will come racing inside and is on edge and takes out her frustration on our couch. :-/


There is no fighting and no hissing as Fluffy is completely non-confrontational and she just nervously hides. 


If I see the other two cats I will chase them off, and a friend suggested spraying them with a bottle of water and vinegar. Well, I am on crutches and just not quick enough.


The Grey Cat is not causing too many problems, but the Big Fat Cat is. He freely enters our home whenever he feels like it. For example last night my husband was in the kitchen and he could hear Fluffy eating the dry food we leave out for her near the back door. He thought it odd that Fluffy didn't come to say hello first before she tucked into the food. Then he saw 'her' jump up on the kitchen table and it was the Big Fat Cat! Bold as brass! There have been other instances too where this cat just wanders in and has a look around.


Fluffy loves sitting in our yard chasing insects and sunning her belly. This Big Fat Cat has ruined that for her. He hangs around all the time. Even after I have chased him off in the middle of the day he'll be back ten minutes later. So she can only relax if I am out there with her.



We have now moved her food bowl away from the back door and further inside the house. Is there anything else we can do to help Fluffy with these invaders?


Bear in mind Fluffy isn't actually our cat, plus we rent and cannot physically alter our house. There is a screen for the back door but we leave it open so that we don't have to keep getting up and down for her (again ‚Äì I‚Äôm on crutches). And besides, keeping it shut doesn't solve the problem as the Big Fat Cat invading her space in the yard.

luizfar,1404567957,29wasx,5,False,6,"Hi! Is there anyone still around here? I hope so :)

I recently adopted my first cat, and since I'd never had a cat before, I started looking up hints to make sure I'm taking good care of him. I was a bit surprised when I learned that apparently you can clicker train a cat without much problems, so I decided to give it a go. It's worth noticing that I have no previous experience clicker training animals either.

By the way, he's a 8-months old cat with no specific breed. It looks like there may a bit of Maine Coon in him because at 8 months old he's pretty big - he's about 4kg or 8.8 pounds.

I started clicker training him about a week ago, we started with charging the clicker, and we were doing about 4-6 sessions a day, pretty quick sessions, with 7-10 repetitions per session.

At this point, in our sessinos we usually do two different trainings:
- targeting training with a stick. I have actually been varying between 2 different sticks so he doesn't necessary associate ""touch"" with that one stick. A question I have is: when should I say ""touch""? Before he touches the stick, or right at the moment he touches it? If I say it right at the moment it will overlap with the clicker, but if I say it before I feel like it may be harder for him to associated the cue with the action.
- calling his name: I call his name, and when he looks at me I click and reward. 

Since I don't have experience with this, it's hard for me to tell if we're making progress, and it's also hard to tell if I am going too fast. As I said, we started training about a week ago, and we're at this stage, does this sound ok?
Also, what are possible ways for me to test that we're making progress without demanding too much from him?
