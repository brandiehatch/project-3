DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

Can ANYBODY validate this experience.  I have done a search on the subject so many times and it's ALWAYS ""the quick is pink.  You can SAFELY cut to the pink part.""

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix.

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix.

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix.

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix.

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis. I am unfamiliar with this product &amp; ofc am looking for advice/reviews on it. I trust my vet‚Äôs recommendation but i would like outside input of their own experience for their fur baby. I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic. Does anyone know whether I should save money &amp; buy the MSM one in the future once i need a refill or should I stick with the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù one from the vet clinic if it is significantly better?

DogCare,uo7qf2,Dasuquin Advanced vs MSM,Hi everyone. Today my 4 y/o corgi was prescribed Dasuquin Advanced for the first time to help with the beginning of his arthritis.

I had seen on Chewy.com that Dasuquin is sold as the regular kind &amp; the one with MSM. The vet had prescribed me the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù one. Obviously paying online is cheaper than buying from a clinic.

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,3,0,3,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,5,0,5,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!

DogCare,uohszh,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",LaTesora,t3_uohszh,4,0,4,0,2022-05-12T19:41:00Z,False
DogCare,uogtzh,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! Forgive the chihuahua title typo.. My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy!
