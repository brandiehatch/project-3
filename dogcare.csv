DogCare,uokuoz,PrincessStorm97,1,Enrichment that doesn‚Äôt involve treats or exercise.,Sad to say my oldest has heart worms. We started her on the treatment today but she‚Äôs gonna be very limited on her amount of ‚Äúexercise‚Äù being kenneled most of the day and/or staying with one of us in our offices away from our other dogs so she doesn‚Äôt get to excited to play. Well she‚Äôs a bit over weight and we‚Äôve been working on getting her weight down and she‚Äôs lost a bit and has been coming down slowly with our two new dogs getting her to run around and play more than she did. She in her nature is a very lazy dog. She loves to lay around and cuddle and isn‚Äôt an overly active dog. Not since she turned one and she‚Äôs five now. So any ideas for enrichment so she doesn‚Äôt go stir crazy that don‚Äôt involve treats or food? I‚Äôm gonna start putting her food in a kong and freeze it and maybe a few treat Kongs frozen but I don‚Äôt have anything else. She‚Äôs a beagle mix but doesn‚Äôt hunt with her nose very much so I have no idea what to do for her to keep her satiated for the next 3 mo. Any ideas would be helpful üíúüíú,0,1652420750
DogCare,uohszh,LaTesora,1,New Husky/German Shepherd owner looking for advice,"Hi y'all!

I just adopted a 5 year old German Shepherd/Husky on Sunday, and he's a total angel. Sweet, gentle, friendly but in kind of a quirky way, smart and affectionate. I'm trying to figure out an exercise routine with him that is sustainable for the long-term and not sure what the best fit is... There are a few factors at play here:

The challenges: Realistically, I'm out of shape, and I also work a lot. I also have other non-dog hobbies and live in a studio in the city. I'm also single/owning my dog by myself. The rescue also transported him to me and didn't know somehow he was heartworm positive, which is going to be tough for us while we are finding our stride together. He also has previously untreated allergies, skin issues, and teeth issues (we are working on getting him healthy!!). This is also my first dog, though I have a lot of experience volunteering and caring for dogs.

The good: I like being active and have been desperately trying to get back in shape for ages, and love hiking, biking, and being outside, I also really want to try scent work with him (maybe once a month?) since he seems to have quite a nose on him. I also have doggy daycares nearby (we visited one today, he liked it a lot and really likes playing with dogs) and dog parks (which I hope to use eventually, after I trust his recall and have had him for a while). 

So.... This is what I'm thinking: 
- during heartworm time: train commands, crate training, etc. (We are making good progress!). Lots of puzzle toys to exercise his mind. For now before he starts treatment he gets 2.5 hours of walks a day or doggy daycare, broken up into morning/midday/evening. 
- when he's healthy: not sure yet - still brainstorming. To other single city dog owners, what realistically and efficiently tires out your dogs on work days? Would love any tips on establishing a schedule!",0,1652409660
DogCare,uogtzh,Civil-Spend2445,1,What temperature can Chiahuahuas &amp; Greyhounds handle? Is it normal to pant a lot? (New dog owner Q‚Äôs!),"Hi everyone! My partner and I adopted a pair of 6-8 (estimated) year old dogs from a shelter back in December. One is a Chihuahua mix (not sure what with) and the other is a greyhound-pinscher mix. They‚Äôve been doing amazing and we love them so much!

We live in Canada, so most of our time with them it‚Äôs been cold (so when we walked them, it was always short and they wore jackets), but now it‚Äôs starting to get hot (between 24-30 Celsius daily is the average). 

I have a few questions that I was hoping for advice on, because I don‚Äôt want to risk hurting my dogs (sorry for the basic questions, I had dogs as a kid but my parents took care of.. well, the care mostly):

1) Are there certain temperatures we shouldn‚Äôt walk them in? I‚Äôve read both breeds can handle pretty high temperatures, but I‚Äôm not sure.

2) Is it normal for them to start panting almost immediately on a walk? Sometimes heavily? They also tend to whine/cry a lot on walks, and constantly pant (even when it was cold and moderately warm, but definitely more so now it‚Äôs hot). Not sure if it‚Äôs an anxiety or excitement thing? We rescued them from a puppy mill, they were previously abused and not allowed outdoors, so we think it may just be them getting overwhelmed (our chihuahua is quite anxious, but doing better! Our greyhound has lowkey anxiety but she‚Äôs more excitable and happy going than anything)?

3) Is there a way to tell between a ‚Äúregular‚Äù pant and a heat stress/stroke pant?

I also want to mention, they both had full vet checkups about a month ago, totally healthy! 

Thank you for any advice!",0,1652406525

DogCare,uijjsa,Demolecularizing,1,Can someone explain what Bordetella is and the role it plays in kennel cough?,"Background: (skip to the last line)

We spent multiple days at a dog show and my dog developed a cough that produced white mucus. He is vaccinated for kennel cough using the oral Bordetella bronchiseptica vaccine. He became symptomatic exactly 7 days after the dog show. Symptoms resolved in 7 days. It spread to our other dog that wasn't exposed to any other dogs. We're finishing up post-symptom quarantine now. The diagnosis was based on being at a large dog show and developing the cough within 2-14 days after exposure.

I'm trying to learn about the Bordetella spp. but no one has any real knowledge about it. The Bordetella spp. is scientifically classified as a pseudomonadota within the bacteria domain. The Bordetella spp. also affects humans, one example is Bordetella pertussis which causes whooping cough. My vet says Bordetella is a ""virus"". Even human doctors say it's a virus.

I'm still questioning why they treat this ""virus"" with antibiotics instead of antivirals... But, that's why they are the doctors.

There's also the suggestion that kennel cough can only occur if the Bordetella bacteria and a virus (that no one can name) are contracted simultaneously.

I have some cultures coming along on agar that I'll stain and identify them eventually. 

I'm completely confused... what science says about kennel cough is contradictory to what professionals in the field say about it.

Can anyone explain what Bordetella is and how it contributes to the condition known as kennel cough?",0,1651706813

She lives with my mother who lives out in the country. Unfortunately the area I grew up in is VERY rural and rough and people don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in beta in the area and neither does my mother. She goes for yearly checkup and shots and that is absolutely it. 

I come to visit Mia once a month, give her all the love in the world, bathe her and brush her (my mom won‚Äôt even do that) but want to do more now that I work and have money. 

I want to send my mother elderly dog food but am not sure what kind. She currently free feeds her so she‚Äôs chunky but would like to get her under a good weight given how old she is and plus I know elder food has special vitamins and such. 

I am also thinking of sending her vitamins + maybe heart worm pills for Mia as well? 

Any advice for how to care for a elderly dog you don‚Äôt live with would be greatly appreciated. 

My mom has agreed to do all this for her, she just doesn‚Äôt get it if that makes sense? But my welder pay girl def deserves to be comfortable in what could be her last year or two.

The situation:

We are transitioning from Cooked diet to a Raw diet for our Mini Schnauzer with a mild case of heart murmur, at the encouragement of a rather proficient dog nutritionist. However, this nutritionist absolutely does not trust vets. Our dog is prescribed Vetmedin for morning and evening. 

The nutritionist has come up with a meal plan of eating boneless food in the morning, and only boney food in the evening. However, she says that the Vetmedin should be taken with boneless food only, which means she‚Äôs suggesting that we can only feed the Vetmedin in the morning, and not in the evening. We don‚Äôt really want to stray from the vet‚Äôs instructions though, and prefer to feed the Vetmedin twice a day. 

So we have a couple of questions:
- Does eating boney food cause any safety issues with taking Vetmedin during or after? 
- If yes, why? 
- If yes, can we feed the Vetmedin three hours after feeding time then, on an empty stomach? Will it be too late in the night?

I adopted my dog in November, she was a 7 month old Terrier mix, spayed female. She is the sweetest pup I‚Äôve ever seen, instantly gelled in with my boyfriend and I. We tried to take her with us everywhere in the initial days, but then read about the 3-3-3 rule and started training her with a virtual trainer. She was doing really well, had slight reactivity to other dogs and didn‚Äôt like being left alone. We were able to work on crate training her and she is able to calm down by herself for a few hours. 
 
We had to go on a 3 day trip last month, so left her with the daycare that she had been to before. They are very pressure free, but I didn‚Äôt realize that she wouldn‚Äôt be checked on at all times. Post the stay, she took some time to adjust and had severe diarrhea, bloody stools and dehydration. For 2-3 weeks she was on a bland diet, and had to go the ER for rehydration and IV for a weekend. 

Now it‚Äôs been about 3 weeks, and we felt things finally settle down, when I saw her puking blood. She‚Äôs currently at the vet, but I‚Äôm literally numb with fear. There‚Äôs a lot of anxiety around her and what she‚Äôs doing, and my budget seems to be getting tighter with a lot of other personal issues.

Problem is I'm an extreme worrier especially over my dogs. And something the vet mentioned was hydration is very important for him especially while he's recovering. Problem is he rarely drank water before this, he's always  been dramatic about drinking water. List of things I've tried/currently doing:

He has 4 bowls available at all times, 2 stainless steel ones, a water fountain and a plastic bowl with one of those jugs to store lots of water

Access to water at all times he just almost never leaves my side. Somedays I sit in the kitchen for hours hoping if I'm near he'll drink, no dice

Adding water to wet food, I still currently do this but I can't add much as he's small so he doesn't eat a ton so it's hard to sneak water in without him not wanting it.

Adding broth to water/food, I don't like doing this as I don't know how much is okay for him and don't want to rely on this forever. Also worried about sodium. He also won't drink the broth mixed with water unless it's mixed into his food

Giving ice cubes, he'll take on and be like cool, smack it around and then leave it to melt.



My concern is just I'm worried he's dehydrated but I'm so paranoid I'm checking his gums all day now. Like are they too tacky? Is that too pale? What's a good pink and whats not? I spent most of the day worrying about him and anything he do. The urgent care vet said not to worry and he'll drink when he's thirsty, that due to the wet food and me sneaking water in it that he might just not be drinking water since he gets enough from that. But I can't help worrying that it isn't enough",0,1650751693
DogCare,uacypi,belosio,1,Piriformis help!,"So my dog struggles with having his glans constantly out. I've been with the vet when they corrected it and I do it the same at home. Its quite the ordeal as he goes from my cute little buddy to...something else when I fuss with it. I'm aware of some hair management down there is required as that is possibly a root cause of his issue as he is constantly licking.  He has a groomer that is more competent than I at addressing it!

This morning it looks like his condition was resolved without me having to do anything which was a surprise because it just doesn't want to stay in 99% of the time...sometimes minutes after correcting it. But he has not been himself and lost his appetite this morning. I can see he is tense and his back is sucked up. He is clearly in pain/discomfort. 

Am I missing something? could it be hair pulled inside causing the discomfort? Or simply not used to being in that position...like new blood flow causing pain? What about ""today"" could have caused it to decide to go back inside on its own???? Any ideas????",0,1650742365

DogCare,tz9rw7,Elentarien,1,Diabetic Dog Refusing to Eat,"So, I have a 5 year old Chesapeake X.  She has always been a super foodie. Loves most anything that‚Äôs edible. 

Last September/October she suddenly stopped eating and after a harrowing week I got her into the vet and after testing her blood and taking a urine sample, they informed me she had diabetes and had reached the ‚Äòcrash‚Äô stage. (After going over how I take care of her, and the diet I was giving her, the vet believes it could be genetic. It‚Äôs unusual that diabetes develops so young and she was already on a low-carb, diabetic ‚Äòsafe‚Äô diet.) They started her on insulin and after another harrowing several days she started to stabilize and eat again. However - she never would eat kibble again. (I did leave some out for a bit and she‚Äôd eat a couple here and there, but not actually go for it when she was hungry.)

Once she fully stabilized, I told the vet I was thinking about switching her to raw instead of struggling with the kibble and she said it was probably the best decision I could make. So - we did. At first it went great. Dog was thrilled with the new food and we blasted through the first box of it. (Using the ‚Äòready made‚Äô meals. So I just have to unthaw the patties/bricks/cubes in the appropriate amount and feed her). Then - she started getting picky. I chose a different box of it for the second round and she was less enthusiastic about that. She didn‚Äôt really like it. Fair enough - we powered through that box. I discovered she rather preferred it frozen, so I would whack the thing up into smaller, more manageable chunks for her (those were the half-pound bricks and rather. . .hard) and let her eat it raw. We managed to get through that box.

However SINCE then. . .she has been getting pickier and pickier. I have tried nearly every brand we have available, in every shape and form. Different protein sources. Frozen and unfrozen. I add treats to it, I chop it up fine, I give it to her whole. . She‚Äôs been refusing to eat more and more. I even started buying real meat, cooking it up and chopping it fine to mix in with the raw so she has the ‚Äòflavour‚Äô/smell of the cooked while still eating raw. It worked for a day. . .

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of trying to feed her by hand - while it worked briefly, she quickly started to refuse and I started shoving it in. She got snarly and bites. (yeah, not the most brilliant decision I made. :P) I stopped and went back to trying to coax/bribe her - which worked. . .briefly, if I added enough tasties to the top.
 
Now she is refusing to eat at all. She‚Äôll eat REAL food (mine!) or treats, but is refusing to eat her dog food. at all. Yesterday she refused to eat breakfast at all. Even with treats.  I did manage to get a small bit of supper down into her by using chicken from MY supper.

Today - I got her to eat an egg with her insulin shot. But she refuses to eat anything else. I finally gave up and put her breakfast back in the freezer. But this is getting ridiculous. I can‚Äôt let her ‚Äòstarve‚Äô until she stops being picky because of the insulin shots. But the whole ‚Äòeating‚Äô thing is starting to stress us all out so bad it‚Äôs not funny. I‚Äôm near tears every time I have to feed her and she‚Äôs getting more and more defensive. Which really isn‚Äôt helping anything. 

I‚Äôm stressed because she will get sick and die if she doesn‚Äôt eat - and the vet just says to make sure she gets the food into her with the shots. But no help on HOW to get her past this insanely picky stage. 

I‚Äôm at a loss how to fix this and am ready to give up ‚Ä¶except that giving up pretty much means she‚Äôs dead.

I see the tactics to use with a ‚Äònormal‚Äô healthy dog. . .but what do I do for a diabetic that *NEEDS to eat regularly???",0,1649441854

DogCare,tw41x9,NativeNYer10019,1,Honey‚Ä¶,"We‚Äôve all heard how beneficial Honey can be but I‚Äôm not sure I knew how beneficial it could be, particularly for dogs. 

So when we adopted our boy from a rescue back in January, we learned that they‚Äôd taken him out of a high kill shelter in Texas, picked up at the Texas/Mexico border off the street by animal control. When we vetted him we found he had kennel cough and 2 parasites - all common ailments of street/shelter dogs. Anyway, besides all the necessary meds, I‚Äôd begun giving him a bit of honey as I read it could help suppress the cough a bit to give him a little relief. But he‚Äôd also had some dandruff, but not itching too much or obvious signs of skin irritation, so no actual skin disorders. I assumed it was just the effects of poor nutrition/health. But after being on the meds, being given honey the whole time, the dandruff seemed to have disappeared so I thought I‚Äôd assumed right with the whole poor nutrition/health issue causing the dandruff. 

However, a few weeks after the med cycles were done, and I‚Äôd stopped giving him the honey everyday, the dandruff reappeared. I read that with small breeds prone to skin conditions, they require more Omega‚Äôs. So then I began adding a splash of olive oil to his meals and some freeze dried salmon to add back an ample supply of Omegas to his diet. I also began bathing him with a bit of coconut oil mixed into his gentle shampoo to make it less stripping to his skin. It helped somewhat but not enough. However, the dandruff was still there.

About a month after he got a clean bill of health, an intermittent cough started. Nothing concerning and not often enough to be a recurrence of kennel cough. The vet agreed that he was healthy and there was no real reason for the cough, probably a slight case of seasonal allergies. But not enough to medicate since it wasn‚Äôt happening a whole lot maybe a couple once every other day. During that time I also thought, maybe the dandruff is because he‚Äôs allergic to the fabric softener I use, because I already use free &amp; clear detergent for the other human allergy sufferers in my house, but the fabric softener I use doesn‚Äôt seem to bother anyone. So I stopped using fabric softener when I washed his things anyway, and considered I‚Äôd wait a few weeks to see if there were any changes. But at the same time I started giving him 1/4 tsp of honey each morning and within a few days I noticed the cough calm down and about a week after that I noticed the dandruff disappeared again. I was then thinking the honey helped with the cough but the omitting fabric softener must‚Äôve been the reason for the dandruff clearing up. So both combined worked to treat both issues. 

But again I wasn‚Äôt connecting the honey to the dandruff, I only thought it was helping with this cough. I just thought the dandruff was the fact that it was still fairly early being with us and his system is merely getting used to his new home and new foods and whatnot and that he just had a reaction to the fabric softener that I‚Äôd stopped using on his things. So since the cough seemingly went away I stopped giving him the honey. 

Fast forward, to a couple of weeks ago, no cough but I gave him his monthly bath and that damn dandruff was back. So now I‚Äôm really stumped. He goes in for his neutering surgery and comes out with a tiny bit of a cough, as to be expected from the intubation during the surgery. So I begin giving him the honey again for about a week. And don‚Äôt ya know the cough AND the dandruff are now freakin‚Äô gone. 

I turn to good ol google to research more about the health benefits of honey and wouldn‚Äôt ya know it, honey helps with mild allergies too!! I honestly never knew that. THAT is what‚Äôs been clearing up his dandruff the whole time but I never connected those dots. Looking back, it seems so obvious, I feel so stupid now!! That damn dandruff  ALWAYS cleared up after about a week of getting a daily 1/4 tsp of honey! 3 months of this insanity, going around in circles ü§£

So that will be his daily protocol moving forward. He‚Äôs a tiny 13lb guy, hence the small amount of honey. I just still cannot not believe something so seemingly simple is having such a positive, beneficial effect on him. 

If you have a dog that has some dandruff but not really any other obvious skin issues, this might be the answer to it for you too! Good luck! ‚ô•Ô∏èüêæ",0,1649084238

DogCare,tvvt1z,karikit,1,Options for managing odor with puppy pee pads?,"I recently moved in with a roommate who has a small poodle mix, I'll call the dog ""pup"".  Pup is well trained and we get along. The only problem is that, she uses a puppy pad in the shared bathroom to pee.  The roommate takes her out for walks 2-3 times a day.  But inevitably Pup will use the pad to pee at least once a day, usually overnight.  

This has resulted in a very stinky bathroom.  The roommate will swap out a new pad every 3 days or so but in the meantime, the pee smell emanates everywhere.  It's hard to properly use the bathroom/shower when the smell is so strong.

I mean to have a chat with roommate about the smell. But want to come equipped with some practical suggestions.  What are my options here? Should I volunteer to take Pup for an extra walk to try to empty her bladder more and hopefully not have to use the pad? Would it be reasonable to ask the roommate to put in a new puppy pad every single day - and I'll just offer to subisidize the additional materials? Are there better products out there that will help with urine odor reduction?   I'm willing to put in a little more funds/work to make this work towards my comfort.

DogCare,tveur3,RaspberryInfamous136,1,Transitioning away from wet food?,"
I have recently adopted a 8 month old poodle x Pomeranian puppy. He has settled in well and we adore him.

His previous family were feeding him low grade biscuits/kibble and raw meat (a mix of beef, heart and horse) morning and night ü•¥

He isn‚Äôt interested in his biscuits at all but scoffs his meat like no tomorrow. 

I‚Äôd like to transition him to higher quality biscuits and lessen his wet food intake significantly. 
I started by cutting the wet food in the morning; he still doesn‚Äôt eat his biscuits in the morning, might graze on them throughout the day, then demolishes his meat in the evening and again, leaves the biscuits. 

I‚Äôd love some advice on how to do this transition for him. Do I reduce the amount of wet food he has each day or just cut it out completely? Do I keep his bowl out for only 15 minutes? Should I add a topper or meal mixer to the biscuits to make it more interesting for him?

Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.

I've had her since she was 8 weeks old and I've been potty training her consistently for 3 months now. It appears she sees pottying outside as a trick, not as a rule I follow her around and tell her to go potty, she finds a place &amp; does it, then I say ""good girl"" and give her a treat. She'll consistently do this. 

The problem is, she still potties and poops in the house and doesn't seem to get it that she supposed to only go outside. I mean, she has accidents like 5 times a day. Also, when I put her outside alone and tell her to go potty, she won't leave the step and just scratches the door to come back in. She only goes potty if I'm there watching with the treats.

What can I do the get her to understand outside is the ONLY place that it's ok to do her business?

DogCare,tklzw6,_philosofia,1,Thoughts and info about free feeding and maybe also my situation?,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is such a long descriptive post. If you got time to spare, do leave some thoughts about my situation. Here‚Äôs some background:

So I have been a dog parent for most of my life until I had to immigrate to a different country (Canada). 3 years after immigrating, I was finally able to get a dog. 

I looked for any dogs that need rehoming in Kijiji. Someone messages me that he breeds pocket bullies and he has one left which is 6 months old. This guy was quite difficult to talk to but was somehow accommodating enough. He was willing to lower the price by so much because she‚Äôs the last one. She was never named. She was also looking a little skinny just because her ribs were showing through. He says that her shots were complete, pee pad trained, and leash trained. She had none of that.

We eventually did get her. We named her Summer. She‚Äôs been with us for a week now. My partner and I have the patience to train her. We also plan to get her spayed. However, it turns out that according to her vet records, she has only gotten the first shot on her 8-week-old mark. The one out of the three. Since she‚Äôs 6 months now and the second shot was long overdue, we have to redo all three shots again plus the spaying.

We contact this guy about it and says that he never told us she has all her shots and that she only has her first. Even if I did mishear him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs dumb enough to do what he did with letting her shots be overdue (or is he?). He says sorry anyway and asked for pictures of Summer so I sent a few. He sees those photos of Summer chilling around our place and all he tells me is this: ‚ÄúU guys shoud be free feeding her fill her bowel n let her eat‚Äù

I have never heard of free feeding before and I‚Äôm tired of talking to this guy. I‚Äôm also taking her to the vet in 2 weeks-ish to get everything done and get some info from the vet as well. I‚Äôm aware that I am partly responsible for getting into this situation where I‚Äôm partially scammed, but I‚Äôm also just frustrated that a breeder is going around seemingly without much of the necessary knowledge for dog care. 

TL;DR: I got a pocket bully (Summer) from an irresponsible breeder and misled me about her shots that are now overdue. He asks that I send pictures of her to see how she‚Äôs doing and says that I should be free feeding her.",0,1648009913

DogCare,tfuli2,jostam,1,Whole day in bed.,"My dog is 7 yrs old, I'm guessing she's a senior or close to one at least. She is a mix breed and pretty small. 

Usually she sleeps a bit more than me, wakes up to have breakfast together and then follows me around through the morning, we take a short walk of maybe 10-15 min. And then she gets back home to a small nap, a little bit of following around and playing and then lunch and repeat for the evening. She's like a small satellite that follows me around through the day and takes short naps to recharge. 

I have a medium sized home with a small garden that according to my vet should be more than enough for a dog her size to live comfortably.

But today she barely got up to have breakfast, a bit later than usual, didn't want to go on our short walk and rather spent the majority of the day in bed. She has been sleeping intermittently for 15-20 minutes and stands up to change position or simply to stretch a bit, comes to me for a few seconds and then goes back to bed. 

It doesn't look like there's anything bothering her, I checked her eyes, ears, paws, skin, mouth, etc. To see if there's something wrong but couldn't find anything.

When she's awake she looks happy, she's waging her tail and looks pretty active, but then goes right back to bed. To be honest the climate has been quite cold, 5¬∞c or 41¬∞F but nothing we haven't seen before. 

Are these signs of aging? 
Could it be just the cold climate?

DogCare,tao0xw,Iowabird78,1,He just keeps crying," 

I took my American Staffordshire Duke (4 year old male) to the vet today. He has been having a lot of problems with itching, especially his ears. He will scratch his ears till they are bleeding, and then scratch some more crying the whole time. He has also been chewing on his back end and his tail, his skin has been real flaky, and he smells awful. I can give him a bath and by morning he's funky again.

So I took him in almost a week and a half ago. The gave me antibiotics and prednisone to give him. He got worse. He was chewing himself raw. The one little bald spot he had is three times the size and red and swollen. So I made him another appointment, vet said going to put him under, clean his ears, do a skin scrapping, and take some blood. I dropped him off at 8 this morning, picked him up at 2 this afternoon. They said the skin scrapping didn't come back with anything. So they switched the antibiotics. Vet also said that did a deep ear cleaning and he had a yeast infection in his ears, they put some medicine in his ears too.

We are home now, vet office is closed. And Duke is not ok. He is crying, and crying and crying. He never whines or cries, he never even barks. For him to be this vocal is very out of character. He is also rubbing his head on the floor at a angle like he's trying to rub his ears on the floor. I tried to rub his ears softly like I would do when he was itching them all the time and he got a little snippy with me. That is totally out of character, he's never done that to me ever. I know something is wrong but I dont know what and I don't know how to help.

I called the emergency line at my vets office and they said to give him a half a tylenol and if he's still acting this way in the morning to bring him in. Does this sound right to everyone? Is this normal behavior after an ear cleaning? I gave him the tylenol but it hasn't done anything to help. It's like it getting worse. He is crying, rubbing his head on the floor and the crying is now mixed with a frustrated moan/growl. I don't know what to do. Any suggestions?

It's gotten worse. He's now crawling around on the floor, actually crawling and rubbing his head on anything he can find. The whining has turned into full on crying and moaning/

DogCare,t8yf5w,Hextant,1,"Need to lose some weight, but ...","Hello! My little rotund pupper is a Shiba, almost 5 years old.  I think she's about 30 pounds, and does not wear it well, as she's very short and stocky for her breed.  Her chest is wide enough we usually have to size up to lg or XL harnesses to fit her.  She's been this way since puppyhood, so I have no worries for that, but I cannot feel her ribs very well and while she has a clear narrowing from chest to hips instead of a bulge outwards in the belly, she's definitely still too broad there.

Disclosure she has been spayed and had a secondary surgery afterwards to move her vagina closer to her backside, as she was born with some extra skin behind the vulva that retained urine and gave her consistent UTIs for the first year of her life until I got a second opinion on her UTIs, since her first vet had no idea and just kept pumping her with antibiotics, sigh.

For activity, she has a large backyard, and we walk her half an hour to a full hour each day.  She isn't the most active outside of walks, because she does not enjoy most toys except laser pens ( which I am reluctant to use unless we can guide her to treats using it, so she feels rewarded for ' catching ' the dot ), so we struggle to find good ways to get her moving other than once in awhile opening the sliding door to the backyard which entices her outside more than her doggie door, lol.  But even then, she seems bored of patrolling her yard after about 5 minutes and comes back inside or lays down outside.

For food, she eats a cup of [Light &amp; Fit Acana brand](https://www.acana.com/en-US/dogs/dog-food/light-and-fit-recipe/ds-aca-light-fit.html) per day, with a [medium Chew-a-bulls toad](https://www.redbarn.com/products/chew-a-bulls-horned-toad) per day, with occasional treats that do not equal more than 100 kcal, only on days she walks a full hour or close to it.

She still seems very hungry some days, and will exhibit behaviors she only has when we forget feeding time ( she will tip boxes or go inside of her cubby, though she will not sneak any treats or food, she just goes in there to indicate she wants some ).  I know part of diets is underfeeding a little bit, but she seems uncomfortably hungry, since usually if it's just a little bit, she knows to wait and she will get rewarded for doing so.

I want to get some low calorie, long lasting chews to help her feel like she is getting food and keep her busy during the day. She LOVES bully sticks, but I'm thinking she has allergy to beef, as her eyes get weepy when she has beef products, so if anyone has recommendations similar to the longevity of bully sticks ( she does not enjoy rawhide alternatives and never once showed interest in actual rawhide either ), I'd be grateful!

I'd also love to know if there's similar quality diet food you would recommend that would fill her up more so she does not feel as hungry.  :)  Right now, I am soaking her kibble in water to help it expand and fill her tummy more, but since I got this new food, she doesn't like it.

I didn't know how much to feed when I first got him since the kibble I got was secon-handed and had no packaging. A friend of mine who had dogs throughout her life and currently have two different-sized dog suggested my to feed one cup per day, which I did.

After the current second-hand bag used up, I bought new ones and got to read the instruction for the first time. The packaging calls for 150g per day, and after weighting I realized I was only feeding 90g per day.

However, my dog went from 8.6kg to 9.4kg since I got him, and the vet said currently he is in the perfect weight range. Should I increase the kibble to 150g or should I keep feeding 90g?

P.S. Kibble isn't the only thing I feed him. He gets a chew treat everyday (a chicken foot, a piece of duck neck, a bunny ear, etc.); some yoghurt to trick him into drinking more water; a tiny portion of ground lean meat and veggie steamed and cooked in bone broth and egg, to trick him into drinking more water.

After I stopped helping it fell to my family (mom, dad and sister who got him I'm the first place) to train and work on him.

He has only gotten worse... he won't even allow my smaller dog in the room without attacking him (he nearly took the smaller ones eye out 2 weeks ago)

My dad is finally on bord for rehoming him (only after he got bit so deep he needed stitches of course) but he called a dogs life and apparently the only option is to put him down.

Its this houses fault I know it, we just don't have the correct dynamic for him. I really don't want this puppy to die because we can't train him.

Or, at least nothing I could possibly have known about. Big relief there.)

So with the shots...from day 1, I have tried to make it as pleasant as possible for my dog. I don't hide the fact that this is what's happening, I let her smell the needle, get her to lie down in front of me, start giving her treats...special ones she just gets for the shots...and gently give her the shot.  When I'm done, I transition the treats into a game of go find it. 

My 'problem' is that I had to transition from using normal syringes...which are getting harder and harder to find and are expensive....to a pen (with the vets approval)...she had started shivering when I go to inject her. Like REALLY trembling. 

She doesn't cry just shivers until I'm done. I'm being as gentle as I possibly can...giving her treats...trying to make it fun rather than a bad thing. I also use the shortest finest needles I could find (that also still work. There is a size down, but I was losing insulin when I tried those.)

In general she's excited when it's time for the shot and will dance with impatience when I'm getting down on the floor. But...it's there any way to make the shot itself easier for her?

DogCare,sxj89z,sunnieisfunny,1,Toys for a dog with a broken jaw?,"Last May, we rescued a senior dog with a broken jaw and rotting teeth. A few months after getting him, around August, he had surgery to get all of his teeth removed. Right before this surgery, the vet realised that a lot of the bone in his jaw was just.. gone. Because of this, the only way for his jaw to be completely healed was to completely reconstruct it with a prosthetic, which would cost thousands. However, once his teeth were gone, he'd be able to live an almost completely normal life, pain free as long as we were careful not to touch his jaw too roughly. 

So, we decided not to reconstruct his jaw, and to let him live without it. I know that sounds bad probably, but the only thing he can't do is eat dry food. He's completely normal in every other aspect, and he's very happy! However, he completely ignores toys after the first time he sees them. I don't know if it's because he's old, or because he can't pick them up with his teeth. Do you guys know any toys that would be easy for an old, toothless, broken jawed dog to play with? He doesn't like peanut butter, so something like a Kong wouldn't be used. I just want to get him some enrichment, because when he's inside all he does is lay around.",6,1645413495

DogCare,stcnz9,justdeanbowlyou,1,Is adopting a second dog off the table when you have a jealous dog?,"We have a female 5yo pitty mix (75% staffy 25% shepherd) who is as sweet as can be. When she's not glued to our sides, she's playing with other dogs or stealing peoples' hearts. She HATES to be left alone. She isn't destructive, but will bark a lot. We adopted a second dog March of 2020 (female, a little younger than OG dog, shepherd mix) who was VERY energetic and playful. We hoped that the company would be good for our OG dog. Well, while they played together, when it came time for dinner OG dog was NOT pleased that new dog was still there. I have never seen her growl or carry on like she did. We had to separate them so that new dog could eat. When it came time for bed, OG dog assumed her normal position at my side. New doggo jumped up on the bed as well. Cue dog fight. It was so scary. My husband separated them and new dog slept on the floor.

The next day was fine (long morning walk that tired both of them out, both napping on the floor). In the afternoon, OG dog is on the couch with me when new dog jumps up on my other side. OG dog starts stalking new dog, across my lap. Cue dog fight. I was too afraid to try to separate them without getting chomped so I stood away from them and tried not to cry (too much). They eventually stopped.

We returned new dog to the shelter the next day. I was heartbroken, but comforted that it was the best choice for OG and new dog.

Over the last couple of years, I've related the story to different folks. I've gotten a lot of reactions involving recommendations about how I should've approached it differently. Had the new dog been male, it would've been better. Had the new dog been a puppy, it would've been better. Had we introduced them slower, it would've been better, etc. 

I'm going back to work full time next week for the first time in months. Husband never stopped working at the office for covid. A little concerned for OG dog's mental health. Should we try again? Or accept that OG dog is a one-dog-household kinda dog?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts.",11,1644957353

DogCare,ssx8b6,PM_me_INFP,1,Obsessed with cat only when my cousin is around,"Hey all!

Apologies for the details, but I just figured in this context it might be useful.  

I just want a little advice. My cousin is temporarily taking care of a friend's dog while he is looking for a pet-friendly apartment. My cousin has another dog and a cat too. This dog instantly became friends with the other dog, but both he and the cat were terrified at each other. The cat then became an obsession to the dog and we kept a close eye on him so that the cat doesn't get spooked, runs off and triggers the dog to chase. 

It is about three months later and the cat has gotten used to the dog, even to the point where she would sometimes brush up against the dog. But the dog keeps locking onto the cat with this gaze as though he is about to launch on her: ears straight up, tail down and sometimes his one front paw curling up. It is nearly impossible for us to break his concentration off the cat. We even tried leading him away with treats. Sometimes when I try to nudge him away he gets aggressive at me and bites me (not too hard at least, but almost like he is giving warning bites). Now the thing is this only happens when my cousin is around. He feeds the dog, gives him brushes etc so the dog sees him as his master. He follows him around the house wherever he goes and if the cat dares get close he will lock on to the cat with that hunter's gaze and, well, the most he has ever done is do a light charge at the cat and nudge her with his snout and nip at her till she gets annoyed and hops off into one of the rooms or until one of us would chase him away from her. Whenever the cat would enter a room my cousin is in, the dog would jump up from his resting place and advance the cat, locking that gaze onto it and often rest in the doorway keeping an eye on the hall to make sure the cat doesn't approach the room. And the very second my cousin would get up from his seat, the dog would see this as a green light to run after the cat, often being interrupted by us who would chase him back on the couch

Now when my cousin is out of the house or asleep, the dog is an entirely different dog altogether. He couldn't care less about the cat. The cat can literally walk over him and he wouldn't even look at the cat. He becomes the most lovable dog that just wants cuddles and head pats and the cat has freedom to go as she pleases without being antagonized. The very moment my cousin is back home, the dog changes and locks its focus back on the cat again. Sometimes anticipating the cat's arrival (she has a bell on her collar) and would proceed to lock that obsessed gaze on the cat and slowly and carefully advance it. He often gives the impression of wanting to do more, but knowing that he would get into trouble of doing so he just locks on to the cat like a target and almost 'freezes' until my cousin would get up.

Perhaps he just wants to play (he is still 3 years old, according to his owner) and is terrified at the cat (who imposes no threat at all). But I am just afraid there is some hunter's instinct or jealousy or need to defend his master from the cat or something that would eventually cause him to actually ambush the cat and maul it. 

Is there anything we can try to get him to stop being so obsessed over the cat?

DogCare,sr42di,cartoonistaaron,1,My little Beagle mix is 18. We're putting him down this weekend. Am I making the right call?,"He's arthritic, has severe hip dysplasia, isn't eating much anymore, doesn't enjoy walks or playtime... six months ago he was still going on long walks and playing a little bit before and after dinner. Now it's just sleep and an occasional bite to eat but he's waking up more and more often yelping in pain. We were getting shots to help with arthritis, but they don't seem to be helping anymore. Special chews, doggie aspirin... there's nothing ""wrong"" with him - he's just old.

It's time, right? My wife is having a really, really tough time with the idea of putting her baby down but at 18 it's kind of beyond where you would go thru extensive tests, treatments, etc... right? Had the little guy since i was 20 and never dealt with an old dog, but it feels right to let him go. Or should I look into doggie narcotic pain medicine and a doggie wheelchair? Vets out here (LA area) are increasingly difficult to get appointments... we have one for next weekend but Ace is in rough shape.

This is a very tough call. My wife is having a harder time than I am with it. But it feels right as painful as it is. Am I on the right track? Should I be exhausting more resources? This forum has been pretty helpful, as a lurker, and I'm hoping I can get a little help one last time.",18,1644707902

When my dog broke his crate and ripped some of my furniture while I wasn't home, I decided that I was gone too long to leave him in his crate and clearly, he could get out of it whenever he wanted.

First things first, I have taken her to the vet. 4 in fact, and she has another appointment Feb 15 and March 31 for more tests. All tests have come back normal, no diabetes**, cancer, GI issues, tumors, or thyroid problems. 

My 5yo Swiss Shepherd/American Eskimo mix will not eat. Her normal weight is around 33-35lbs or 15-16kg. Right now she weighs 28lbs or 12.7kg. I‚Äôve tried different kibble, adding wet food, mixing with different meats (usually chicken or beef), hand feeding her, bone broth, stopped giving her treats and people food. Nothing has worked. What worked yesterday will not work today. I got her to eat for a while when I would take her food and pretend to ‚Äúcook‚Äù it with mine, I‚Äôd even warm it up a bit, but that stopped working after a week or 2. She used to be free feed, but she got sick roughly 2yrs ago from the raw food I was feeding her (I didn‚Äôt know better, as soon as I realized the food was making her sick I switched it). After that she went on timed meals. The adjustment was hard for her at first, but eventually she got used to it.

Now, about 3 months ago she started skipping breakfast and would have to wait until dinner to eat. This became such a common thing that I stopped giving her treats (she would get a bunch throughout the day) to try and force her to eat more. She would always eat dinner though. As of late, even when I pull out top shelf food, the kind only for special occasions, she won‚Äôt eat that either.

I just need her to eat until her Feb vet appointment. Hopefully this specialist can help more. Though I must admit, I have a sneaking suspicion she might be diabetic. She only had her urine tested once, but all her symptoms (not just her lack of appetite) scream diabetes to me. Any interim help is beyond greatly appreciated!",0,1643827099
DogCare,sinzbz,AboveFyu,1,How much wet food should I feed my dog per day?,"I rescued and adopted my dog Potato two weeks ago. He's a mutt of unknown breed, about 1 year old, weighted 9kg atm. My vet said he's a little on the skinny side but not really underweight.

Currently I feed him 150g Orijen kibble per day. I walk him twice a day, 30 min each plus about 5 min of post walk play time, so he's not that active. But Potato doesn't like drinking water. I know it's winter and he's not very active, but he could go on a full day barely touching his water bowl. I change his bowl twice a day to make sure the water is fresh.

I work from home and I love cooking, so after reading how lack of water can affect a dog, I figured I can try make some wet food for him in order to make him take in more water. I've tried some smaller testing batches with different ingredients and he loves it all, will even drink some of the leftover soup if given, so I want to change his diet to maybe 60% kibble and 40% wet food. However, since a dog needs to eat more wet food than dry, I don't know the amount I should give him per day. I tried looking up dog food calculators but they usually are for commercial wet food or you need to know the exact calories per portion. I tried to ask my vet about it, but he couldn't give a clear answer and insist I buy commerical wet food instead.

My recipe so far is 80% meat (chicken, beef, muttom, fish, shrimp, etc.), 10% veegtable (carrot, zucchini, cucumber...), 10% carb (pumpkin, pea, brown rice, whole wheat flour, oat, etc.), throw in an additional egg per pound, all ground up into a paste then steamed until solid.

In his current home, there is a cat and he loves getting into the kitty litter (unfortunately). Even in spite of that nasty habit, his breath is a bit rank sometimes.

There are tons of ""best"" lists online but I want to ask actual pet owners and whoever else may peruse these forums who knows a thing or two: what's the best toothpaste for dogs?

I'm mainly looking for:

* The most effective in maintaining oral care
* Cruelty-free, organic, basically no shit ingredients that will be a detriment to the dog's health, etc.
* Relatively inexpensive

DogCare,sdvhcz,Rohkha,1,"Posted in r/Dogtraining yesterday, got closed, so I'm posting here now: Looking for dogfood for my pup (also: Farmina and WSAVA guideline requirements)","I have a 9month old Corgi pup who has been doing terribly on Purina Pro Plan since we got our new bag. The kibble looked and felt very different to the usual bags. He started pooping 6-10 times a day instead of his usual 3. He also got Giardia (unrelated) shortly after, which is why I thought that maybe Giardia was the reason why he would poop as much. But as soon as we switched to a hypoallergenic dog food during his treatment, his poop quantity went down almost immediately (less than 2 days).   


I now have to start switching off the hypoallergenic brand (Virbac Gastro), as it is meant for dogs with stomach and renal issues, so that was just to help fix his gut flora during the treatment. I'm now looking at alternatives for dog food. I don't want some random boutique brand that looks good and marketted towards me as a human. I don't necessarily need ""human grade"" food and shit like that. Dogs actually need byproducts like organs, but even stuff like feathers, beaks, carthilage etc, it shouldn't be just one or the other though.   


I'm looking into viable foods and because of the DCM issues showing up since 2019, I'm very wary of buying something that just sounds good. SO I'm also looking for brands that do feeding trials to make sure there is some credibility to their claims. One of the better ones I thought I found was Farmina, which works closely with an Italian Veterinary University and does feeding trials in real life conditions (with house pets, not lab dogs). Their nutrients meet all the AAFCO guidelines, and on paper, they seem to meet all the WSAVA guidelines now with their feeding trials being more and more active. So how comes it isn't considered as a brand that meets WSAVA guidelines?  


I have also read some people reporting bloody diarrhea on farmina. I really just want to find something that will let my dog be healthy and not have so many stomach issues. I don't currently have the time or space to go full Raw. I'm considering looking into finding a dog nutritionist and set up a diet plan eventually, but none are very close by.   


Any recommendations? Any thoughts on farmina? Could I do better, worse? I don't care if I have to pay 60 or even 80bucks on a 12kg bag, I just want to make sure I put my pup in the best disposition to live a healthy life. If you have any more questions, do not hesitate.",0,1643279729

I gave 5 days of Capstar and didn't see any fleas while treating, but saw fleas again 3 days after the last dose of Capstar.  

I want to choose the least toxic treatment out of the orally prescribed treatments from a vet.

A step higher on the toxicity scale were s-methoprene or pyriproxyfen and the article said to avoid synthetic neionicoinioids - like imidacloprid and dinotefuran.

My vet prescribes Nexgard (afoxolaner and milbemycin) or Bravicto (fluralaner) and I don't know where these fall in the toxicity scale.  I have son who is sensitive to many man made chemicals and worrry about his reaction.

I was able to do a couple of walks with him before the winter stared. But now that its winter time, I haven‚Äôt taken him on a proper walk. The last time was probably two months ago. We live on a condo so we don‚Äôt have a backyard for him to run even for a short period of time.

Although we attend a weekly puppy training class and I bring him to puppy social hour at the daycare once a week or sometimes once every two weeks (where puppies and sometimes, well behaved adult dogs get to play indoors for an hour). He goes crazy there and I feel so bad seeing him go wild and happy for only such period of time. :( At home he just sleeps a lot or follows us around. I try to give him puzzles and play with him but he gets bored so easily and isn‚Äôt really food motivated. 

I wanted to try to leave him on daycare for a full day but its really not financially viable for me at the moment. 

I‚Äôm also scared to drive around and bring him to hardware stores / pet friendly stores lately but I try to do it from time to time. 

He also hates boots and were still slowly trying to get him to wear them. We use some protective paw balm when we go out and whenever he walks on snow but I notice that he lifts his feet from cold and whines and shivers even on -10 deg weather :( 

I feel so bad seeing him bored and sleeping all day at home. Sometimes I feel like he would have been so much happier if he was on a different household. How do you guys know if you are giving your dog the quality life they all deserve? And where would you draw the line?",0,1641891529

My dog is 16 years old. He is a pretty energetic small chihuahua terrier mix.

He was diagnosed with a UTI on Monday this week and got put on Clavamox for the bacterial infection. After a night of a lot of pain and discomfort the doctor prescribed carprofen. 25MG a day.

2) waking up a lot at night to walk around, drink and pee 
3) has a little jaw twitching thing 
4) sensitive to sounds

It's been a long time and most of my experience with infant animals comes from kittens or mice, so while I have some sense regarding the situation, I don't know in what ways dogs differ and what I should look out for. 

For example: The puppy (Edith) has just begun eliminating on her own this morning. Should she be pooping after every feeding? 

How fat are puppies supposed to be? I think Edith is a blue heeler. She's pretty stubby, but I'm not sure if her belly is a bit bloated or she just looks that way on account of being a dog. She's taking less of the emergency milk mix* I made than I figure she ought to and she burps sometimes. 

At what age can I increase the time between feedings? I've currently got her schedule set to every 4 hours for my own sanity. I checked online before scheduling her this way and what I've read says it's alright. I also read that she should be able to begin weaning around 5 weeks. How do I go about that? Formula in some wet dog food to get her used to solids?

*My aforementioned family member is notoriously unreliable and also happens to be my only way to the store, so Edith is currently being fed on 

4oz Whole milk, store bought
4oz water
2 egg yolks
About half an oz of vegetable oil

I found this recipe online to be used as an emergency formula. How long can this be used for safely? How can I improve it? I've been feeding her this for two days while I try to get my family member to bring me to the store for a bottle and some proper formula. We don't have vitamins drops or anything like that here, so I'm not sure what else to add to make it more nutritionally sound and I don't want to experiment in case something I try is unsafe. In the event I cannot make it to the store, will this be safe to use until I can begin weaning her?

There's a lot going to be said in this post and I'm looking for opinions, advice, and more specifically if anyone has had similar problems with their dog and what they did / what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got an 11 year old Pomeranian, named Frodo. Totally normal, spunky dog until another dog attacked him and broke his arm early 2020. Vet's had to put him under and fix his leg. He was put on a bunch'a drugs post surgery and recovered completely by the end of 2020.

Enter 2021...

Frodo continues to be normal up until late summer where'in he begins licking his paws constantly. At first we suspect its some kind of stress disorder but we soon found his hair falling out and skin dying indicating the issue to be arguably worse. This also began to spread, thus we brought the issue up to the vet who eventually had to put him under, again, and do a biopsy which confirmed it was an autoimmune disease that was destroying the blood vessels in his skin. The vet prescribed him antibiotics but they didn't do anything.

Currently, the problem is the worst in his armpits, theres a bit of it under his chin and around his groin as well as all four paws. We keep him in a cone and with bandages on so he can't lick any of it.

Frodo still acts relatively normal, somewhat perky, but clearly has lost weight. He sleeps more than he's awake, and smells of death.

We've been thinking about putting him down because it looks nasty and painful but we're hesitant because he still acts somewhat normal. We're suspect that because of all the trauma from his arm and having to go under so many times that his immune system (specifically his gut) has been all janked up. We give him goats milk each day and he eats a lot but its hard to say if there's any progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had similar issues? has your dog outlasted it? Did you end up putting them down / how long did you wait before doing so?

However, in his older age (approaching 10) certain things trigger almost a mental breakdown for him. It never happened until the last couple of years.

He goes into a sort of trance where it‚Äôs as if he cannot hear us. He goes on a destructive rampage, trying to dig. Usually into bins, bags, wardrobes. He shakes, pants and becomes very difficult to snap him out of it. He‚Äôs clearly very stressed/scared.

Every vet/dog psychologist we‚Äôve had over hasn‚Äôt helped. Prescribed sprays and pills from the vet do not work.

He only goes into this weird state when his usual routine is disrupted (a group friends coming over, being taken to a crowed area, loud or strange noises like a whistle or a door slam etc). 

Obviously we try to avoid this as much as possible but we can‚Äôt control external noises or preventing guests coming over.

It‚Äôs got to the point where even just our small family laughing at a movie will send him off. It‚Äôs annoying to deal with but I can deal with it, the main concern is that he is so stressed.

We‚Äôve tried thunder shirts, hemp treats, prescription sprays/meds, maintaining a quiet and relaxed atmosphere, playing music to hide external noises. Nothing works. Sometimes I think he‚Äôs going to give himself a heart attack.

DogCare,rmjpdg,sicklyjordyn,1,What should i do?,"So I recently started working at a home owned/operated pet ranch after being in grooming for 1.5years and i‚Äôve immediately found so many problems with how it‚Äôs run. When i got there i learned that the owner was taking the dog food given to him by the pet owners and dumping all of the baggies of food into a tub which he uses to free feed all of the dogs all day. as for canned foods or anything that‚Äôs NOT dry dog food in a sandwich baggy doesn‚Äôt even get touched!! he puts it to the side and forgets about it. when I confronted him about this he told me ‚Äúdogs should be able to be dogs and just eat whatever‚Äù I WAS STUNNED. I‚Äôve been trying to convince him to feed them all their proper foods at the proper times and reminded him that THESE ARE NOT HIS DOGS. i told him he should treat them as their OWNER wants/expects of him and he agreed that we would do that but on the condition that myself alone would have to feed them. (i‚Äôm his only employee besides 2 KIDS 13&amp;15 who are only there for 2hours a day MAX) I agreed with the best interest of the dogs at heart and took on the task of feeding them one by one. no problem right? no. i could only find the food for HALF of the dogs and as i was searching through the fridge in the kennels i found medication for a dog that checked out. IT WAS UNTOUCHED. there was enough medication and pill pockets for each day the dog was there. so not only is he not feeding these dogs properly but he also isn‚Äôt giving them their medications! while i was feeding the small dogs (which he does NOT kennel) i wasn‚Äôt able to properly feed each dog because none of them had their OWN KENNEL. as i was trying to solve this dilemma he went behind my back and took all of the bowls and just threw them outside for the dogs to ‚Äúpick and choose‚Äù(his words)except one of those bowls were dosed with the dogs medication! when he just threw it on the the ground HIS old rottweiler (which is food aggressive) immediately ran and ATE the medicated bowl of food! I‚Äôve had enough. i TOLD HIM that that bowl was dosed BEFORE he put it out and he did NOT listen. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. i don‚Äôt want to leave and let this place keep being run this way but the owner is too stubborn to change!

He was living with a family, but had to be rehomed because he was becoming agressive to anyone who'd enter his home and was a stranger to him, as well towards kids.

Over the past two weeks, I've noticed him becoming progressively hostile to people. Specifically, when we'd be returning from a walk and getting close to my house or if another dog was nearby (up to 30+ meters), when he was playing with a dog he encounters.

At home, he's a sweet heart, that loves affection and stays almost a few inches from me, at all times.

A trainer I've recently started working with, informed me that he's most probably has a very territorial instinct. That it may increase as he gets more comfortable in my neighborhood and what he sees as his territory grows.

Sometimes I add rice, salmon oil, flax seeds, chicken broth, wet food, or eggs to his foods. It's sporadic because sometimes he doesn't want to eat at that very moment and so he will walk away from his food.

DogCare,qtquqf,Designed987,1,My Dog Was Diagnosed with Kidney Disease. I am Looking for Help with Diet Recommendations Please,"Hey everyone,

So my dog was diagnosed with kidney disease about a month ago. When she was diagnosed with it, she also had a uti which made her symptoms much worse. For the past 2-3 weeks she has been doing much better and is very happy in and of herself, thankfully.

I have been reading up about the type of diet you should feed a dog with kidney disease. Our vet recommended Royal Canin renal food, which she has now been eating for the past week (dry food). 

However, I am trying to weigh up whether I can combine the Royal Canin food with a natural diet (or even go down the full natural diet route). When my dog was sick, I was giving her boiled white rice or potatoes with boiled eggs and it didn't take long before she started gaining a lot more energy and I noticed that her coat was smoother too. However, since she has been on the Royal Canin, whilst there is nothing wrong with her and she is happy in herself, she does seem lazier. I've noticed her coat has become rougher too.

Have any of you been in a similar situation with your dog? Did you feed them a special dog food or go down the more natural route?  Looking at the Royal Canin ingredients too, it's loaded with wheat and gluten and just doesn't seem like a very natural product. Phosphorous content is low though.

For context, my dog's last blood work, which was just as she was coming to the tail-end of the uti was BUN 30.4 and creatinine 384. (This was before she started the Royal Canin).

Thank you",3,1636899902

Basically, she can't keep anything down but is as hungry, thirsty and energy filled as usual. I am blaming the bone we let her chew on yesterday.

It's a big beef bone that has some raw meat on the outside and marrow inside that is sold specifically for dogs and that she's enjoyed before, but since it's been a while I'm guessing that particular bone yesterday had too much fat and did not sit well with her. I explained this to my vet and she said to keep an eye on her for today and gave me some pills to help her stomach for the next few days which she has to take in the morning before eating anything else. I just read online that in these cases you should not give the dog food or water for 12 hours to give the stomach some rest and that otherwise they're likely to just vomit whatever you give them. My vet and the internet have already said that any significant loss of appetite or otherwise unusual behavior warrants a check up so I just want to know if anyone has gone through something similar and how they started giving their dog food again or anything else i should watch out for.

Tomorrow they will perform a barium test as well as start a round of steroids as a last-ditch effort to reduce possible inflammation in his system, although I understand the steroids could aggravate his pancreatitis and make the situation worse.

Then he starts to show behavioral issues, will get really antsy after his dinner, will beg for an hour or two, and throw a little temper tantrum if we don‚Äôt give him more. 

When I first brought him home, I was a little heavier on the treats for the first two weeks. However, when I took him to the vet I learned that he gained 5 lbs in ten days. I don‚Äôt mind because he was a little underweight coming out of the shelter and now he‚Äôs at a healthy weight, but I would like to be at maintenance now rather than surplus. 

Other notes:
- I am feeding him 2.75 cups of Hill‚Äôs Science Adult a day (this is what the used at the shelter). 1.25 in the morning/night, 0.5 for training throughout the day. 
- I give him his meals in a snuffle mat to slow him down
- Occasionally, I hand feed his meals or use it for more training when he seems up for it
- I give him one Kong (L) filled with a turkey, rice, veggie vet approved recipe I found and make weekly
- He gets small treats throughout the day (a cube of cheddar cheese, a spoon of PB, or some Buddy‚Äôs treats)
- He gets a Whimzee/Fresh Kiss before bed every night 
- We go on three walks a day or two walks and a 30 minute session of fetch (he goes hard). About 2 hours total. Otherwise, he mostly sleeps. 
- He‚Äôs been on meds for kennel cough for over a month (had it coming out of the shelter and it still isn‚Äôt better. working on it with the vet. not sure if this affects his appetite/behavior)

She was lying on our carpet at 11am on tuesday when she suddenly got up, started screaming and acting like she was running away from something. She ran straight to me and even though i was holding her and calming her down, she continued to scream while she lied in my lap. The screaming continued for about a minute as to which point she went stiff and didn't get up for about 3-5 minutes. She then got up and walked/ran normal and had been eating and drinking normal. initial thoughts was our other dog hurt her or a bug bit her but our other dog was asleep and we found no bugs. Next day around 3pm it happened again. This time she was biting the air and ended up getting my finger while screaming. This continued about the same amount of time and she was fine after. We rushed her to the ER vet where they couldn't find any physical trauma to her and didn't do any x-rays so they prescribed carprofen (100mg), amoxicillin (400mg, i think) and said it was probably a muscle strain or pinched nerve. Since getting home and taking these meds (she's been on them since wednesday), she seems more tired/lazy and uncoordinated. She has been a clumsy dog in the past but this seems different? She hasn't played with our other dog, when she tries to run she slips about and ends up walking most of the time. She does not yelp or seem in pain when falling or running , just not acting how she usually does. I don't know if this is from the medication or if it is some muscle problem or maybe hip/elbow dysplasia.

They were foul smelling and had some discharge and she was scratching at them. Anyways i'm just wondering if anyone has any clue about any of this. She is still eating/drinking normal, and still peeing/pooping normal. they were not worried about any intestinal or internal problems as her stools are normal and there is no blood.

I left her there for a bit frustrated that she would not listen.  She was by the patio door waiting for me to open the door. Wasn't long. But was that the right thing to do? Is this like a punishment? I feel guilty, but she does this quite often. I've tried treats, but I feel like she'll do this just to get the treat. BTW she's a very smart dog and understand a lot.

The day before yesterday my dog got sick and puked, like normal kibble and grass. Then yesterday I got back from a job interview and found he had vomited blood. Immediately called vet and after discussing possible toxins he suggested doing blood work and gave me an option of x-ray tho he said he doesn't think it's an obstruction. The entire time my dog is acting normal, energetic and playful. The vet gave him a shot for nausea a medicine to protect his stomach, and told me to get Prilosec OTC.

I've been giving him chicken and rice, which he's been happily eating and drinking his water. But since he's been to the vet, where he was having solid poops, he's now having diarrhea, and some of it is bloody. Vet did call earlier in day me his blood work looked great but he did have an increase in white blood cells. He did advise he could prescribe something if the diarrhea continues. It wasn't bloody at this point so I couldn't discuss with him.

Emergency vet said he should be fine to see regular vet tomorrow as long as he's not puking. I'm going to call in the second they open. But I wanna know if anyone has had any similar situation, or can help me get some idea of what is going on with my baby....",5,1635592645

* **Species:** I'm not sure she's a mix-breed but she's quite small
* **Age:** 6 Years and 11 Months
* **Sex/Neuter status:** Female sterilized at 10 months old
* **Breed:** I'm not sure, but she's pretty small
* **Body weight:** Around 6-7Kg
* **History:** She suffered from malnutrition and a lack of calcium when we adopted her at 2 months old and had a great recovery. A month ago she broke one of her nails while playing and had to get sedated for the vet to cut the nail and cauterize it. Nothing else.
* **Clinical signs:** A week ago after we got home from a walk she went to sleep under the sun, after her nap she tried to stand up but couldn't gather strenght for a few seconds, I saw that she tried to stand and rolled over, but after a few seconds she just got up and continued like normal. I Inmediatly called the vet and he told me not to worry, that it might have been due to exhaustion.  
Today while having lunch she extended her left paw up, and almost fell down, started lowly crying and tensed up all her body, she barely kept herself up. I have a small recording of this in the google drive link i'm putting at the end of the post. I believe this is a seizure and it lasted close to 30 seconds.
* **Duration:** The seizure was around 30 secs, and those two symptoms in the last week are all that happened
* **Your general location:** I live in La Paz Bolivia, the climate is dry and cold. Average Humidity is around 20-30% and the temperature is 18¬∞ Celcius or 64 Farenheit through the year. It's 3600 meters over sea level, I don't know if that's relevant but usually people move to lower cities for health concerns so i think it might be relevant.
* I added some photos I have of her that i thought might help to see her size and similaraties she might share with other breeds, I'm not too knowledgable in dog breeds, so i couldn't point out any similar one. I already made an appointment with her vet for tomorrow morning, but i would really appreciate some more insight i could get on her condition or what is going on with her. I really love her, I recently lost my dad due to some neurological pathologies, so my mother and our baby dog are all I have left, and it's really frightening to see her go through something similar.
* Here is the link to some photos and the short video i took today of her

DogCare,qatf0q,Alastrine6,1,"Help!! Puppy is hyperventilating/stress panting for unknown reasons. I‚Äôve been through my list of potential causes and nothing is adding up, context in desc.","This is going to be long because there‚Äôs a lot of context that needs to be covered, but please help! 

My 5 mo Sheltie puppy started stress panting/hyperventilating after his first nap of the day yesterday. He gets enforced naps because he can‚Äôt fall asleep unless he is in his crate. 1 hour up, 2(ish) hours down and it‚Äôs been working great for us. He‚Äôs loved his crate since day one, willingly goes in there, sleeps like a rock in there and doesn‚Äôt complain unless he has to pee/poop. He gets plenty of mental and physical stimulation throughout the day, pees immediately before and after naps, gets proper food and water, etc. He‚Äôs a very good boy. 

Background: He went to the vet the day before yesterday for a rash on his underbelly/groin and they gave us antibiotics and a steroidal cream. Before this he was very itchy and seemed kind of uncomfortable (as one would be if they had a bad rash!) but was acting completely normal in terms of activity and mentality. We started the antibiotics and cream that night and then he got another round the morning that this started. He seemed to almost instantly be much less itchy and the rash looks much better.

Yesterday he was completely normal, got him up for the day, put him down for his first nap after an hour and he slept like a rock for 2.5 hours as is usual for him. When he got up again, he was completely normal, and nothing was out of the ordinary. He was happily chilling in the kitchen watching mom cook when it came time for his next nap so I let him stay up an extra 15 minutes. 

When I sent him to his crate for a nap, this time he started to pant after about 5 minutes and it sounded like a stress pant. I was like ‚Äúokay, maybe he got overtired bc I let him stay up later. I‚Äôll wait and see if he settles himself.‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt settle, it just got progressively more frantic until he let out a couple whimpers. When he needs something he will whimper to let me know, which is why I let him continue panting. When he started to whimper I took him outside to see if he had to poop, thinking that might be whats bothering him (he peed right before going to bed). He didn‚Äôt, and didn‚Äôt act like he had to (I know what his ‚ÄúI have to poop‚Äù looks like). Instead, he seemed really frantic like he was scared of something‚Äî he would scurry around panting and then stand and look at me like he was distressed. I took him back inside and he did the same thing, he just paced around panting like he was anxious. 

We thought ‚Äúmaybe his rash is bugging him? No I doubt it‚Äôs that, he‚Äôs been scratching way less and it looks less irritated‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe his teeth hurt? But when his teeth hurt him he doesn‚Äôt act like this, he paws his mouth and lets out a few whimpers‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe he has to poop? But he just pooped a few hours ago and he isn‚Äôt doing the ‚Äòpoop walk‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe he‚Äôs started his adolescent fear period and has decided he‚Äôs scared of his crate out of the blue? But he‚Äôs acting weird and panting still even when he‚Äôs been out of the crate for for over an hour, and he‚Äôs only just turned 5 months!‚Äù 

He ended up being awake for about 7 hours with maybe 30 minutes of sleep total. He was acting less scared/weird by nighttime and when I put him to bed for the night he panted lightly for about 5 minutes and then slept perfectly through the night. Acted completely normal this morning and then this all started again when I put him to bed for his first nap of the day :(",9,1634583601

DogCare,q90tlb,Alastrine6,1,Is it okay to leave my puppy to play alone in his pen for a while when he doesn‚Äôt feel like playing by himself?,"Okay so this is kind of a difficult question to summarize in a title. Basically, my puppy (4.5 month Sheltie) is usually good to just play by himself whenever I leave him in his pen to go do something elsewhere in the house, when I need a break from entertaining him, etc. I don‚Äôt leave him in there for very long (probably maximum 45 minutes) and it‚Äôs only while I‚Äôm in the house. He has tons of toys, water, chews, etc and like I said he is normally fine with playing by himself when I leave the penned area. 

But sometimes, he just wants to be a cranky little toddler and complain that he‚Äôs not being entertained. He‚Äôll just sit there at the edge and/or jump up and whimper, or wander around feeling sorry for himself. He‚Äôll straight up refuse to even try to entertain himself in what I assume is protest. 
He‚Äôs taken on plenty of walks/adventures and given lots of mental stimulation. I play with him probably 80% of the time he‚Äôs awake. By all accounts I‚Äôm certain he‚Äôs just being cranky with me. 

My question is, is that okay? Can I just leave him there to sulk if I know his needs have been met and he‚Äôs had plenty of mental/physical stimulation? 

I thought to ask because right now he is doing this and nothing seems to be good enough for him. I try to play with him? No not good enough. I give him chews? Not good enough. Okay, so I leave him there to figure it out himself‚Äî he has a tantrum. :|",6,1634343089

DogCare,q4yila,Elentarien,1,Dog Won't Eat,"My dog is almost 5 and had been a total foodie all her life. I feed her kibble bit for the last few years I've been giving her a half kibble half real food diet. I'd put in half her 'alotted' amount of kibble, then do some real meat, a bit of pumpkin, some veggie, and some bone broth as gravy. She loved it. I can change it up with what is in the house. 

But...she's suddenly stopped eating everything except 'treats'. Her meat treats or people food she shouldn't be having. She won't eat her kibble regardless of what I put in it. She won't eat pumpkin. She won't eat her snack carrots. She won't take the bone broth. She won't eat wet dog food, or the left over cat food.

I have tried giving her some yogurt before she data to help with digestion. I have hand fed her. Ice cooked up some hamburger and given her some of that along with some of the juice in her kibble....that worked for one meal...then she wouldn't touch it again. 

And yes...I have changed her kibble out and started a new bag of a flavour she loves...and while she ate a bit...within a couple days we're right back here again.

In all other ways she is acting normal. She is happy as anything to go on her walks...she enjoys a few treats to sniff out in the long grasses, and she's been  normal at home. Her poops are normal...though much less of them obviously. 

But I am getting worried. She refused breakfast yesterday, ate half her supper when I hand fed her then refused breakfast again today. I have tried playing the ""Well starve then"" card and taking the food up until supper. Even tried giving her her walk first to help her build up an appetite. But....we got back and I happily get her supper for her...and she won't even look at it. She just turns away and goes to sleep of the walk. 

The only other thing I can think of is that we are in an insanely stressful environment. I try to keep her in my room where is quiet and stress-reducing music is playing...but...yeah. Help!",6,1633829667

Starting yesterday he had a few accidents inside which wasn‚Äôt like him (just pee) every 35 minutes or so, I figured maybe he got into the cats water which he did but wasn‚Äôt aware he was outsourcing water from not having enough. 

We cut off his water around 5 PM yesterday per usual schedule for bed but he still had to go out every 45 minutes or so until 3 am. Woke up at 7 am and walked him again to find out he peed in his crate which he‚Äôs never done.. fed him a little extra then normal today and water and he threw it up about an hour later. 

At this point he seems fine, he threw up and was playful with the other dog. Contacted the breeder and was told that he needs water so I put a full bowl in his crate, they said he‚Äôs going to drink it and throw it up but he needs water. Full bowl of water later he was done and threw some up later on he‚Äôs still been kinda playful but just seems extra tired, hes peed probably 20 times since drinking all the water. 

Called vet for emergency appointment they said they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an emergency and scheduled him for tomorrow 

Should he go to an ER? I don‚Äôt see how if he was so dehydrated why he would still pee every hour clear as day.",4,1633720544

So i have a small but old male dog (around 11 years old) who has not be neutered and I just recently got a female golden retriever puppy (a day ago). When i first brought the puppy home, i put her downstairs in the family room and separated the entrance with a baby gate so they can sniff each other and get to know each other. At first he did not care and proceeded to ignore the puppy but later he started to investigate and they were sniffing each other through the gate. So at one point i removed the baby gate and supervised their interaction. What i noticed was that my male dog was licking her genitalia and he would not stopped. After like 5 mins I separated them and put the gate back. Ever since then, my male dog has been super excited. His tail is wagging fast and he is panting like crazy with his tongue out. He keeps running up and down the stairs like crazy and he is trying his best to see her again.

Hi! I am new around here, so forgive me if my question sounds clumsy. To provide some context for it: I live in a big house with my mom, my dad, my twin siblings, a cat named Tigresa, and a collie named Winkie. Recently, Winkie had breast cancer.

Luckily for her, it wasn't as serious as it could have been, and the vet removed it successfully. She is in great shape now but is still struggling. She had been suffering from the effects of cancer for a while before we noticed something was wrong.

My dad thought it was her leg, so we stopped taking her on walks, and, after the surgery, we didn't give her baths for a while either. She had reacted badly to the products the pet shops were using before, and we didn't feel like we would be able to wash her at home without damaging the wound.

After her recovery, we bathed her, then traveled for two days after a while, and she ate just dog food during this time. When we came back, her fur looked stunning! This whole process has been a big wake-up call for us, and we resolved to be better owners to Winkie. She still has a long way to go, though.

And thus, this brings us to the subject of this post: my mom and my dad think it would be a good idea to get another Collie. They believe that if we get a puppy that looks like Winkie, we could trigger her maternal instincts so she would heal better and faster. I am not sure this is a good idea, so I wanted to see if you guys could give me feedback on that.",5,1632784734
DogCare,pwl283,MoshPotato,1,Is it ok to keep a dog in a designated area even when we are home?,"TL;dr

My partner has set up a large play area for our dog where she spends most of her time.  She is small and the area is about 20 sq feet. I want a second dog but do not want to keep her in a pen.  Which one of us has the right idea? Pen or no pen?

------‚Äê---------------------------

My partner and I have had two dogs in the past both of those dogs became my dog and went everywhere with me. I was their human and they were my dog. 

Last year I lost my dog due to illness and it broke my heart. I wanted another dog  immediately to fill that void. My dog was what was getting me through the pandemic. 

At that time my partner suggested a puppy but he wanted the puppy to look at him like our previous dogs had been with me. I always adopted but finding a dog during the pandemic was impossible so he decided to purchase a puppy. I didn't have the money to purchase a puppy or cover vet bills such as spaying. We agreed that we would get a puppy but she would be his puppy and he would cover all her expenses as I had done in the past with our other dogs. 

The dog is now 18 months old and fully grown at a whopping 17 lb. She gets into everything and has a habit of eating anything she finds. As a little 3lb puppy she spent a lot of time sleeping in her crate.  As she grew my partner purchased a 4 by 5 play pen that would be exclusively hers and was lined with linoleum for easy cleanup. The pen is in our living room and I am home most of the time. 

When I bring her out into the main room she loses her mind and we'll run around continuously until she goes back to her area and falls asleep. I love her to pieces and now that time has passed I would like a dog of my own. My concern is that I've never kept a dog in a pen before but I've also only had older dogs. We have cats and we want to protect them and the dog from unnecessary stress.

My partner says the dog has to be in the play area and I'm not ok with that.  It's his choice how to take care of his dog but I don't want that for my dog.  I also don't think it's fair to have one dog free and the other in a pen.  

So for now I have given up on my own dog.  I'm pouring all my love into the dog we have.

Is he hurting the dog by keeping her in her play area? I think he is over protective but she is safe so I can't argue that.  

Should we be letting the dog have free reign when we are home?",24,1632760996

DogCare,pw4l6b,wallerox,1,"Out of these 3 vacation arrangements (or others we might not be thinking of), which would be best for our rescue pup?","Hey all, I posted this yesterday in r/dogtraining and was told it would be better suited here, so sorry if you've already seen this post. I would really love your advice on something :)

We adopted our 3-year-old Huskey-mix about a year ago. In about a month and a half, we're planning on going for the first time on a vacation that includes (at least in part) a fancy hotel that doesn't accept dogs.   We have thought of a few options for Whiskey (our dog) and were wondering what you think would be the best option for him:

Option 1) Go on a 7-day vacation, where the first 2 nights he's with us 24/7 (we find accommodations that accept him) and for the last 4 nights we would use a night pension that is close by to our hotel. We would leave him there every night and pick him up every morning to spend the day with us. Advantages: spending most of the time together, the hotel is in a beautiful area with lots of national parks that he would love. Disadvantages: we're concerned it would be really hard on him to say goodbye to us every night. He has never stayed at a pension before, and we wouldn't be able to slowly introduce him to the pension we choose because it is far away from where we live. So it would basically be like leaving him with strangers every night.

Option 2) we go on a 5-day vacation, leave him at home, and pay a dog-walker to take him out 3 times a day. The dog walker would be someone we vetted and introduced him to before the vacation, but no one he's had a long-term relationship with, since we've never had to use this kind of service before. There isn't anyone in our neighborhood / family that he already knows that we could trust to do this for us or be comfortable enough asking, which is why we would use a paid service. Advantages: he stays in a place that's familiar to him. Disadvantages: he's mostly alone for 5 days. 

Option 3) we go on a 5-day vacation, leave him at a full-time pension near home. We would vett them in advance and introduce him to them before we leave. Advantages: it would be a place with other dogs for him to play with while we're gone, we have the time to form a relationship with them beforehand. Disadvantages: he's without us for 5 days, we don't know in advance what other dogs will be there with him and how well he'll get along with them. He's usually pretty good and gets along with most dogs, but will act defensively and won't back down if he feels threatened. Also, he gets anxiety when locked inside crates. There are pensions that don't separate between the dogs at night in crates, but not sure what would be better for him - risk of altercation or separation anxiety?

Which option would you choose? Why? Are there any other options we aren't considering? What preparation should we do for whatever option you think is best?

Relevant background info:
- We've never left him on his own / with other people overnight before
- he's been with us on multiple vacations and adjusted well to the new environments when he was with us 
- he was abandoned and chained by his previous owners when he was a bit younger than two years. we think it's why he acts out in crates and hates being alone. We did positive crate training with him for months, he loved his crate when we were home (even with the door closed) but tried to break out whenever we weren't (damaging both his teeth and the crate from anxiety) until we realized the problem resolved itself when he could roam the entire home (no behavioural issues ever since).
- I work from home so he's used to spending very little time alone. He follows me around the house (will hangout wherever I am, always). He's gotten better about not always following me to the bathroom, although that still happens occasionally. He still cries after I leave the house (despite giving him a top treat every time), but goes to sleep shortly after without issue.
- he loves people and is very friendly towards strangers. Very trusting. We've never seen him act aggressively towards anyone.
- We don't live in North America

Thanks in advance!
It's my first time posting here so please let me know if any important info is missing.

Edit: one of the commenters in r/dogtraining suggested to consider getting a house sitter for the entire time we're on vacation and leave him at home so that he stays in his usual routine without getting lonely. We're not quite sure who we could ask to do this, but we're considering this as a possibility as well, if anyone has any advice on how to make this kind of arrangement work well.",0,1632697886

I asked the tech who took my pup inside of the veterinarian can call me before the start of the procedure to let me know what is being extracted and why, but the tech was incredibly dismissive and stated that the forms are just a formality and no big deal. 

Especially considering my pups other health issues, extractions are a big deal to me, if for no other reason than having to change my schedule around to make sure he heals properly.

They will literally bark nonstop for *hours*. The longest I‚Äôve let them go before is an hour and half, the entire time spent not going more than 10 seconds without barking.  
For one of them I can kind of solve it by moving  their crate into the guest room with me, but that just makes the other one worse as it‚Äôs left alone (it has a larger pen-type area that I can‚Äôt move).

This can‚Äôt be good for the dogs and it has me only getting a couple hours of sleep a night (near dawn, when they finally stop). I‚Äôve tried all of the common tips to stop them, but nothing works. Help!",23,1631521052

We're currently struggling to get our girl's nose healed up. It started with three minor spots on the top and sides of her nose but each time a scab forms, she licks at it and the scab comes off so the injury is getting worse. The vet says it's caused by allergies.

She's currently on Teva-Clindamycin for fighting a bacterial infection in the wound.

I read somewhere that you can get a topical cream to help heal the nose that only needs to be applied for 30 seconds. I could handle that. But as soon as any scab starts forming, she licks her nose and it gets ripped off.

He nips (mainly to play or when he‚Äôs LIT) but has only mean bit once or twice when he was much younger. I love him but when he doesn‚Äôt want to do something, he‚Äôs a massive pain in the butt. He knows plenty of commands, and I train with him daily but he‚Äôs such a self-assured butthole that when he decides he doesn‚Äôt want to do something he just won‚Äôt. 

Sometimes when he gets muddy paws, I‚Äôll wipe those off before he comes inside and he mean growls at me. Doesn‚Äôt snap but he hates his feet being touched.

When he was little I‚Äôd get my wife to hold him and I‚Äôd do the trimming. We had a little handheld electric file thing that helped shave them down but it took a long time and he hated it. I also have some clippers but I haven‚Äôt used them yet. 

I‚Äôve let his nails turn into daggers and even a playful swat (his only siblings are cats and he‚Äôs adopted some behaviors lol) can break the skin. They are SHARP. 

I‚Äôm not too worried about him snapping. He might but he won‚Äôt do any real damage to me other than a scratch. I‚Äôm kinda worried about clipping too close to the quick because the nails are dark.

So my question is: do you have tips? Other than feeding him and making him used to it via positive reinforcement (have tried for months with holding him and touching his feet, no progress) Anything I can do to practically to help? Especially as one person? I don‚Äôt want to take him to a groomer because he‚Äôs so rowdy and squirmy I don‚Äôt want them to get injured accidentally. And I‚Äôm not convinced he wouldn‚Äôt snap at someone else if he got fed up. So I need to do it myself. Tips, tricks, advice?",17,1629525262

I have a 15 year old, blind, spoodle. He has always been prone to ear issues (floppy ears you know aha), so we always have antibiotic ear drops, and pet saline ear cleaners on hand. Usually, if the ear cleaner doesn‚Äôt work, the antibiotic drops do the trick, but this time his ears are still so itchy. 
His ears also look pretty healthy ((apart from redness caused by constant itching, and a small amount if wax but no discharge and no smell of infection)) 

So then I suspected ear mites, so we got the vet to look at his ear. She didn‚Äôt suspect anything wrong with his ear, despite us telling her how much it stresses him out. 
He spends ages pacing and panting, completely hacking at his ear, and it makes me so sad (( he also has cushings disease, so when he starts to panic, the adrenaline sky rockets and he has panic attacks over his ear being this itchy)) 

It‚Äôs driving him insane. I feel that I have tried everything. I looked in his ear to check for hair stuck inside, or any sign of what the issue is, but nothing.

Do you think that he could have something stuck inside? But that would cause an infection or at least a lot more wax buildup... Please give me some more ideas!!! We just really want him to be comfortable during the last year or so of his life.

DogCare,p1ae1b,KonaBoda,1,Should our senior dog get a blood test for Cushing's disease?,"We recently adopted a 13-year-old miniature schnauzer who was, when we got him, 37 pounds. We have thankfully gotten him down to 31 so far, and on our first vet visit, the vet had concerns that he might have Cushing's disease, due to the shape of his stomach. We paid $156 for a preliminary blood test, and now the vet says they need to do another test, in which he will stay at the clinic for 8 hours and will cost $333.

I know caring for dogs can be expensive, especially when they're old and have health problems, but I'm wondering if this seems worth it. We did some research on Cushing's, and it seems like the only potential symptom he has is peeing a lot. He does not have any hair loss or skin lesions, he is very active and lively (especially for his age and weight), and there doesn't seem to be any weakness or lethargy. He gets tuckered out after 10-15 minutes of walking in the hot Summer, but I don't think that's unreasonable for his condition. The vet also said that his heart, lungs, eyes and joints all seem to be in very good condition.

On top of all that, it seems that Cushing's is a disease that takes years to fully develop, and as much as I would like our boy to live more than a few more years, we're not extremely optimistic about that. We're not incredibly poor, but $333 is still quite a bit of money, for a disease he might not even have, and even if he does, it might not effect him until the end of his life anyway. What do people here think? Am I being reasonable, or should we definitely have it done?",1,1628542808
DogCare,p18mv7,renha27,1,New puppy has live tapeworms in stool after supposed deworming every 2 weeks since birth. Is this possible?,"The title pretty much says it all. I got my puppy (8 week old Labrador Retriever) yesterday evening. The people I got him from say they have dewormed him and his litter every two weeks since birth. They also say that he pretty much lived in a sandpit with his mother before this and had fleas as a result, and that they've bathed him in dawn to cut down on the fleas, but still let him and the other dogs live in the sand pit. According to the previous owners, his most recent deworming was two days ago.

The tapeworms are quite active. They're crawling out of his rear onto his tail, onto the floor*, they're in his feces. I'd say the ones he is passing when he defecates are about two inches long or smaller, and the ones crawling out are maybe half an inch or smaller. 

I wasn't expecting this because he is quite large, doesn't have a pot belly, and appears to be a healthy weight, etc. Even his coat is shiny and soft. 

Under these circumstances, is it possible that the previous owners are lying about having dewormed the puppies? Is it normal for worms to be quite active after a deworming, or are they supposed to be dead in the stool/dissolved in the intestines by the medication?

I have contacted a veterinarian in my area and will be picking up medication for him asap, but I am burning with curiosity on this and Google isn't helping so far. 

Tl;Dr New 8 week old lab looks healthy but has a very active tapeworm infection. Previous owners supposedly dewormed him every two weeks since birth, but continued to let him live in a flea infested area at the same time. Is it possible for them to have dewormed him on the claimed schedule and him to still have such an active infection?

I have noticed she hasn't been pooing everyday as she normally would (at least once a day she will poo). Everything else is normal though in terms of sleeping, eating, peeing.

I had asked a vet before about it and he just waved it off, saving she is being naughty and playful.

The only change that has happened is a while back I switched her from grain-free food back to food with grain after the whole stupid scare from The Hills Diet, claiming grain-free food may be associated with heart issues.

For reference, my dog was diagnosed with mitral valve disease this January and has been on medication since then. I don't know what to do with her and am not sure what a vet could do aside from an invasive exam or something.

I'm assuming this is a dog food issue although he does have a bad habit of eating grass on walks (we're working on a ""leave it"" command). Should I switch back?

When we brought it up at the vet while they were taking the sample of her lump the vet wouldn‚Äôt even see us to check it out and the tech commented that it could possibly be muscle atrophy which would be worrying. We‚Äôre finding a new vet, but in the meantime if anybody has seen this or has any ideas I‚Äôd be so grateful. 

She‚Äôs 4.5 years old, mixed breed (best guess is lab + greyhound based on google searches) if those breeds have anything that could cause that. I‚Äôve searched google and found one other person that posted here but apparently this is uncommon.

DogCare,opdl5d,PrinceTBug,1,Worried about my Dogs (help?),"I live with my brother and we own a couple dogs: a female pitbull (Pitt) and male chihuahua (Chi). the pitt is very sweet and not aggressive towards people ever. the chihuahua is not as comfortable and frequently growls or yaps but doesn't really but when around new people. They're both on the older side, but their age doesn't always show.  
The two of them interacting with each other is a little different, though. Normally they are just fine, and mostly just ignore each other while sharing a space. Pitt will sometimes initiate play with Chi but usually just to nab affection from one of us humans. They also somewhat fight over food. Pitt generally seems to be the instigator. They have separate food/water bowls and she frequently comes over to chi's dish and gets in his face, regardless of how full or empty her own bowl(s) are.   
Sometimes they can get really bad if Chi growls too much in response, Pitt will bark at him and apparently even nip.  
Yesterday, Pitt bit at Chi suddenly without provocation as far as I could tell prior to it happening. They were near Chi's food dish but not really over it or anything. Anyway, Pitt had her mouth around Chi when I stepped in, and he seemed to be injured in the ear afterward.  
He's been very touchy on that side of his head and yelps even if it is grazed too forcefully. Normally, I have to keep them in my room during some of the day while I sleep, as we don't have a dog door or a mat for them to pee on and unless they stay in here they'll pee in the house.  
I'm worried now for Chi's safety. The two interacting and him yelping in response to the pain from his hurt ear might set Pitt off and we know she's not beyond biting... Right now it looks like I'll just have to stay up all day or keep one of them in another room and hope they don't make a mess.  


My brother is a vet, and I asked him this morning about it. It seemed like he wasn't worried about or just hadn't noticed. Though it was just before leaving for work and surely he'd just gotten up. That and I'm unsure he knows fully what happened yesterday.

DogCare,oik4h9,_miserylovescompanyy,1,Help with Insurance Recommendations,"Copied from another post!:

Hello all,

Sorry if this doesn't belong here, I'm just trying to get some initial advice to begin my research into this.

I have a beautiful 2.5 year old 65 lb German Shepherd and Husky mix. She's my whole world. She has no preexisting conditions, but it feels like she's been to the vet several times already and the vet gets expensive. She's been there for her yearly checkup, for surgery when her paw pad was split open from playing outside which included pain meds and blood draw and anesthesia, getting spayed and random small things in between. Today was her last day of board training and the trainer thought she ate his sock and she almost had to be induced for vomiting and have x-rays taken and be given meds (luckily he found the sock and all was good). But this was my last straw with paying a lot for the vet. We (partner and I) don't ever want to NOT take her because we can't afford it.

So my question to you all is this: do you have insurance for your pup and which one is it? What visits does it include and how much does it cost? Ideally I'd like an insurance plan that covers the random things we've gone for or almost been for which includes yearly checkups, blood draw, Xrays and all of that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just want my baby to have a long and healthy life and I think having insurance would help!",9,1626064627

Athena does not seem to be in any pain. The only reason I noticed is because she asked for a belly rub. She does not react at all if you touch the bump.

I have a 15 month old toy moodle. The last 7 days when we go to bed at night she is very agitated and can't settle for a long time.

Our sleep routine is normally that she sleeps in her crate which is next to my bed, and sometimes in my bed. When I let her sleep in my bed she curls up (under the covers) down at my hip. Up until last week, whenever I do this, she will just instantly curl up and fall asleep.

Now if I try that, she refuses to be under the covers but instead sits on top and sits upright, eyes wide open, looking at the wall. If there's any noise she is suddenly very alert and wants to get up and look.

Even if I put her in her crate now, where she would previously just lay down and be quiet, she'll whine and sit upright as well.

Eventuallllyyyy she falls asleep, and when she does, she is fine being under the blankets or in her crate.

During the day she is in this room and sleeps on my bed or on the couch just fine! It's only at night.

There's been no changes to environment, routine, no new next door neighbour pets. The only thing I can think of is that there is a rat/possum in the roof and she can sense it, but even when it's absolutely dead quiet, where you could hear a pin drop, i can't hear anything.",0,1625180615

DogCare,o4526g,VirtualSpinach,1,"My dog won't pee in our backyard, only on walks","Sorry, this is kind of long.

I had a dog (senior female), and recently adopted a 2nd dog (8 year old male). Shortly after dog #2 came home, dog #1 passed away unexpectedly.

Luckily dog #2 hasn't needed much potty training, he just kind of knew not to go in the house. When we go on walks he happily urinates all over the place.

The few days that I had them both, when I took them outside to use the bathroom in the back yard, dog #2 would pee everywhere, even in places where dog #1 had never peed (like along the fence, on some wooden posts, etc).

Since dog #1 passed away, however, I can rarely get dog #2 to go potty in the yard. Once in awhile he'll go but most times I take him out there he just stands there or follows me around without doing anything. This is even after 12 hours of not peeing overnight! He doesn't seem uncomfortable but it's definitely making me uncomfortable to think about it üò¨ He normally gets two walks a day, and there are times he won't pee in the yard but then half an hour later he'll pee within 2 minutes of starting a walk on the street.

To complicate matters, he's a picky eater and doesn't seem to like any of the treats I've tried. So all I can really do is praise him heavily when he pees on walks and use a word association but it doesn't seem to help. I also use his leash when we're in the yard hoping he'll associate it with walks but no luck so far.

My question is, is it better to minimize the walks while I try to teach him to go in the yard? I don't want him to learn that if he holds off peeing long enough we'll go for a walk. But I also don't want to cause him any pain or harm due to not urinating enough. It's only been a couple of weeks since we brought him home and lost dog #1 so I know he's going to go through an adjustment period... I'm just not sure what the best approach is while he's adjusting.

We definitely need him to use the yard at night, as my neighborhood after dark isn't the kind of place I can take him on walks before bed.

Are there any treats I can try that even the pickiest dog would view as high value? I've tried turkey and string cheese and while he doesn't spit them out, he doesn't seem excited about them either. He loves affection so praise and pets are all I am able to do for now.",8,1624193554

Anyone had experience with this?,"He has had episodes of blood in his poo before, and they've either cleared up on their own, with antibiotics (Metronidazole), or we have noticed the episodes often would arise when he would show symptoms of anal gland issues, and when they get expressed, symptoms would subside. The amount of blood is small and occurs as bright red on the just the external tip of the poop, sometimes with a mucus attached to it. Often after pooping, he will lick to clean (sometimes seems excessive) and we are able to check with paper towel and we will find residual blood.

This current episode started a couple weeks ago, and we took him into the vet to get it checked out. They tried to express his glands, but they weren't full. The doctor wasnt urgently concerned, but prescribed us Metronidazole and told us to give psyllium husk as a way to treat potential inflammation in the intestines. The symptoms stopped with use of Metronidazole (5 day run), but have since recurred. Has anyone else had success in treating this symptom?

I am going through a horrible period, I am very stressed and I do not stop crying because on the internet I read that tartar can cause infections that affect the heart. My mother doesn't want to hear about the operation. Only a 1% chance luna could die because of anesthesia scares my mother. It's a clear no. I have tried to speak to her several times but her answer remains no. I'm so scared, I don't want my dog to have infections and at the same time I don't want to risk her life. I have to tell you that Luna, despite the plates of tartar, never complained of pain in her teeth. Eat normally. Her gums do not appear to be inflamed and fortunately do not bleed. Luna continues to play normally with her toys (and bite them) without complaining. SHe's got a bone, and she doesn't have a problem with that either.

She may or may not have eaten any, I don't know. She has no symptoms.

Having spent half an hour frantically googling I can tell you that 99% of mushrooms in the UK are safe to eat and 95% of all mushroom toxicity deaths in dogs are down to the death cap (if it was a mushroom, it definitely wasn't a death cap).

Has anyone else encountered this? Any tips on how to train or redirect this behavior?",2,1623204331

Once boisterous and full of energy, your pet may now seem to slow down, have some difficulty walking, tire easily or seem less exuberant or even restless-and seeing them in pain makes you feel helpless, doesn't it?

DogCare,nipfs4,ZombieRapperTheEpic,1,Help with special treat suggestions for dog with sensitive stomach?," 

So my girlfriend has a couple of basenji dogs. I like to be able to bring them a special treat when I come to visit. If you know anything about basenjis then you know they are particular and everything is on the dog's terms. Bringing these dogs a special treat helps me to build a relationship with them and has really helped to make them comfortable around me.

Here is the issue. The one dog has a bit of a sensitive stomach. I used to bring pig ears for them (I've brought them 3 times). One dog had no problem and really enjoyed the treat without issue. The other dog would enjoy eating the treat but would throw up after. We tried giving her half instead and it was fine for the first half but then about a week later we gave her the second half and she vomited again. This usually happened a few hours later.

I'm wondering if you all have any suggestions for something special I can bring her instead. Clearly she has a sensitive stomach and this treat is not good for her. My girlfriend has lots of treats that they buy in bulk and give the dogs on a regular basis. What I'd like is hopefully something that really is special and the dogs can easily recognize it as being different than their usual. I realize that you don't want to be messing around with their diet or changing it dramatically by introducing new food that they aren't used to. With that in mind, these dogs regularly have a fairly wide array of treats including greenies, duck based, rabbit based, pork liver based, and even turkey treats.

Obviously I can't bring pig ears again for the one dog as it's clearly not something that is good for her. Are there any suggestions of something I can bring her that might be easier on her digestion while still being clearly special to the dogs?

Thank you in advance for your help!",15,1621709794

So she stayed with my mother who has a big fenced in back yard in the mountains, it made me think about my dogs quality of life. 

My husband and I have a town home with a tinsy  winsy backyard but I bought a kiddy pool for her back there that we play in together. 

Her lifestyle is a bit different between houses. With us we take her to the park/ dog park twice a day religiously because she is a 25lb aussie.At my mother's house she just stays mostly in the back yard and wonders the house.They walk her occasionally.

So my question is what kind of environment or life style is better for her? The other issue is she definitely has separation anxiety. She does pretty well being in a kennel alone but that's about it. Would she rather be with me then a brand new family with a big yard(my family wouldn't keep her)?

We might be moving to another country and I'm willing to shell out $$ to keep her and have a place close to parks like we are now, but we wouldn't have a house. What do you guys think? Should I rehome her or will she be fine living with me?.

DogCare,na8kwj,raybutts,1,Dog yelping from being touched but only sometimes?,"My dog has been showing some strange behaviour since Saturday. My roommate was petting her Saturday morning when she suddenly yelped. I tried feeling around her and putting pressure on different areas but nothing else caused that reaction. She began acting very lethargic after this. Later in the day, she got tangled in my purse strap in the car and began yelping once again. After that she began drooling and had no appetite and wouldn‚Äôt drink water. She also yelped that evening when my dads dog approached her (didn‚Äôt touch her, they‚Äôve been socialized many times and never any issue), yelped before going through a doorway (also not touched, the door swung towards her though), and yelped when I blew air on her back (usually loves this). I took her home as vets were closed on the weekend hoping she would be ok through the night, planning to take her to an emergency vet the following morning, but by the morning she seemed a lot better. No more drooling, her appetite had returned, and she was starting to act more like herself. Monday showed more improvements, and today she‚Äôs almost fully herself. There were 2 more yelping incidents Sunday, 1 on Monday, and none today. Her energy has also almost fully returned. I‚Äôm confused as to what is or was causing her pain because she isn‚Äôt yelping every time she‚Äôs being pet or picked up, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be from any specific spot.

DogCare,n6kzec,Sean6943,1,Unknown disease in dog,"

I have a mini schnauzer - SARGE!!- who is 19 months old. He suffers from a condition that so far no one has been able to diagnose.  He‚Äôs been to the regular vet, an oncologist and to the animal hospital at the University of Florida. He‚Äôs been poked, prodded, scanned, and every other test under the sun with no success. It is nothing genetic. 

It started when he was about 4-5 months old, maybe 6 months.  His body literally shuts down. His neutrophil levels drop dangerously low. This lasts for 3-5 days and then all of a sudden he is back to being our loving playful Sarge. 
Sometimes it starts with him regurgitating his food that he ate 8 hours earlier. Or he might just throw up bile. Or it will be nothing at all. He will feel hot to the touch. During his downtime his symptoms may include all or some of the following:

Lethargic
Doesn‚Äôt eat 
Won‚Äôt drink water or tries to drink it and it just runs out his mouth- we will use a dropper to get him water 
Walks with an old man‚Äôs gait
Will just stay curled up in a ball
Sleeps all day 
Will stand there for long periods of time and just can‚Äôt lay down(we have to assist him to lay down)
Has diarrhea or hunches over like he has to go but nothing will come out 
Shakes/tremors -  not seizures 
Fever- this is a consistent symptom 
Excessive saliva around mouth 
Will go into seclusion under bed or in crate- when he does this we know it‚Äôs going to be a bad one. 

Once he goes though this he is fine and then like clockwork in 9-11 days it strikes again. 

When this first started it was really really bad- so bad that the oncologist called us in to to say goodbye to him. Thank goodness it has gotten better(?) to the point we know it‚Äôs coming and how to manage it. 

Is there anyone out there that has experienced anything like this at all or can shed some insight? Thank you in advance!",1,1620344136

I had his thyroid levels tested and he came in low, but borderline for treatment. I changed his diet to 100% home-made and put him on an herbal thyroid supplement. And it worked! Over the last 3 months, his fur has come back, his coat is shiny again, he's got more energy. Now I'm wondering if it was from the diet change, the supplement, or a magical combo of both. They have both contributed to him being more expensive, and we're living in lean times.

So if you were me, would you 1) start re-introducing kibble to his diet and see what happens 2) take him off the supplement and see what happens or 3) just keep him on both and maybe give up avocado toast or whatever else it is preventing me from having a savings account.

DogCare,n0wvdd,susie_bennett,1,Puppy with upset stomach even on bland diet,"Our lab puppy came home to us at 7 weeks with diarrhea.  His littermates also had upset stomachs.  The breeder said it was due to stress associated with a long car ride.  We gradually transitioned him to science diet puppy kibble, and that made it worse.  We fed him egg and rice with kibble only for treats, still bad.  We switched to chicken and rice, only egg whites and rice cubes for treats, still bad.  Like waking up every 2-3 hours with diarrhea.  Vet did lots of tests and everything came back normal and suggested we continue on the bland diet.  Vet prescribed hydrolyzed protein kibble to use as treats.

Now he's almost 4 months old.  We've stuck with egg, rice, and chicken.  We've found a pre-made product that seems to really help: stella and chewy digestive boost food toppers.  We give him some each day and adjust amounts depending on how firm his stools are.  They seem to really help, but they're pricey!  So we began augmenting his diet with various things as treats: freeze dried chicken, rice+tuna homemade treats, egg white+rice frozen treats,  oats+sweet potato homemade treats.  As long as he's getting plenty of the digestive boost food toppers, he's generally ok.  He's getting bigger and I'm spending way too much time making food for him, so we've been giving him the prescription HP kibble to help bulk up his meals.  It seems to lead to terrible diarrhea.  It's unclear if it's because we used fewer digestive boost food toppers or because the prescription kibble doesn't agree with him.

I need to find a store bought option to bulk up his meals.  He's a growing boy! Do you have any suggestions about things/brands we can try?  Our vet seems to think we should just stick with bland diet, but it alone isn't enough and it's too much work to fit into our life.  Also, we'd love the option to use bully sticks and similar tools.  He's super active and happy and not showing any other signs of being sick.  We've taken him to the vet so many times for this issue and run lots of tests, so the vet doesn't seem worried about him.",6,1619670883

DogCare,mtn5ri,badwoolla83,1,Should I handfeed my dog?,"I have a 4 month old yorkie named Milo. He is on scheduled feeding, he gets a meal at 7:45 am, 12 pm, and 5:30 pm. However he will not eat his meal during this time, I have to leave it out and he will graze when he feels like it.

I'm worried about this. I'm scared he is not going to eat and then get low blood sugar and crash. He will eat if I hand feed him though.

 I know that hand feeding dogs encourages a bond between dog and owner, but I don't want him to be dependent on me. I don't hand feed him everytime I feed him, maybe just three times a week, but should I or should I let him eat naturally?",3,1618785172

DogCare,mt0sgn,T--Frex,1,Cutting feathering/tail on a double coated dog?,"My GSD/Aussie mix has some very... Intense feathering on her butt/back legs (aka pantaloons) as well as a very long-haired tail. There does seem to be some undercoat in this are but for the most part it is quite distinct fur: very long, thin, dry, frizzy, and dense. It's probably 6 inches long on average, maybe 8.

Her leg feathering gets urine on it, no matter how much leave in conditioner and brushing I do it gets tangled probably because the urine makes it sticky. Her tail literally drags on the ground if she relaxes it and she's very sensitive to it being brushed so it tangles as well.

Can I cut/trim it without impacting the undercoat? I'm mostly wanting to use clippers and a guard to get it about 2 or 3 inches long every few months but I don't want to do that if I'm going to adversely impact her coat in some way. Because this isn't the typical over and undercoat fur, can I get away with breaking the 'don't clip a double-coated dog' rule?",1,1618699267

DogCare,mr34mr,Imhopeless3264,1,When is knowing what is wrong enough?,"Well, I think this title is messed up but so am I. My dog was diagnosed with cancer today. He‚Äôs a 6 year old schnauzer mix. My vet took cell samples and x-rays last week (and it doesn‚Äôt look like the tumor has spread) but the cells were inconclusive as to the type and stage of cancer. We went to an oncologist today and she THINKS it‚Äôs soft tissue sarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma. She needs to do a CT scan and biopsy to confirm this. If it is, she says the best treatment would be to amputate his rear leg, possibly into his hip and a long life could not be guaranteed. Hubby and I are in agreement: we have the $ and could do this CT and biopsy, but I‚Äôm struggling with spending this $ to make him miserable from the biopsy and possible amputation to learn that he‚Äôs going to leave us sooner than expected. He‚Äôs got no symptoms right now and chases around, barking and playing with toys, jumping up on our bed and furniture. If we don‚Äôt have the CT and biopsy we could let him live as comfortably as possible for as long as possible but we wouldn‚Äôt know what type of cancer he has for certain. So what I guess I‚Äôm asking: for those who may have been in this situation, does it/did it matter to know the type of cancer if the outcome will be undesirable either way? The doctor gave us no indication this wasn‚Äôt an aggressive cancer (it‚Äôs apparently grown from not there to the size of half a grapefruit in 6 months, we didn‚Äôt notice it because he‚Äôs always running around and behaving normally. Our vet found it when he was in for his bordatella.) So, will it matter, did it matter to you, to know the name of the cancer and its aggression? Does not knowing make it any easier? If he has 3 months with all four legs and is happy and relatively healthy otherwise, is that better than 6 months with 3 legs and the trauma of surgery? I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm rambling this has been a hard day. Thanks for your advice and comments.",0,1618444198

DogCare,mqy5dy,reallybigleg,1,How to stop bathtime from becoming a trauma?,"I just tried bathing my puppy for the first time and I'm feeling a little traumatized myself from her squeals of terror. This is not my first rodeo with dog baths. I grew up with dogs and dog sit for family. The one thing I've never been able to cope with is seeing the terror of a dog being bathed.

I put a towel down in the bath so it wasn't slippy, peanut butter on the sides to lick off and recruited my mother to hand feed peanut butter too - at one point we let her just sticky her head in the jar! The water was tepid to prevent discomfort and we tried to make it as brief as possible but her squeals went right through me and afterwards she trembled for ages and is now running about the living room like something possessed.

So. My mother thinks I just need to toughen up and ignore the screaming. This is the fifth family dog I have bathed and I've been doing this since childhood but I'm not showing any signs of toughening up. Is there anything I can do to make this less terrifying for the dog?

She's a border collie, by the way, same as our previous dogs. I've no idea if they're particularly sensitive to this, but I guess they do have a reputation for neuroticism so maybe?",6,1618428878

Long summary

I have an 11 y/o German shepherd.  She started leaking urine when would lay down about 3 years ago.  Took her in for a lot of tests and the vet came back with ‚Äúolder fixed female dogs have this problem some times‚Äù and prescribed her proin.  

The proin helped reduce the leaking but never fully stopped it.  She gradually started leaking more over the last year.  I had switched her to a new practice that was closer to home.  They did their tests and came back with the same conclusion.  They had me double he dosages of proin but it did not solve her leaking problem.

Then COVID hit, and her vet stopped seeing us in person.  Through phone tag with his office, he gave us a prescription for incurin to try as well as refilled our proin prescription.  

On both medications - not a single drop.  You could see a positive change in the dog‚Äôs mood - perfect.  

After a month, the vet office called and said they accidentally filled both prescriptions and that she should only be on the incurin.  Two weeks later, she is back to leaking.  

In talking to the vet office, they don‚Äôt put dogs are both - their policy not specific to my dog.",3,1617735053

Alright so I got 2 full grown males, which are a bit large ill add, and I am looking into adopting a female german shepherd. One of my boys, named Winston, is a 1yo 90lb rottweiler/doberman mix who is a sweetheart to literally anyone he sees, be it humans or other dogs, not an aggressive bone in his body. He is not neutered. The other dog, named Jeep, ~2yo (rescue) 60lb neutered australian cattle dog who at first was a bit of a awkward dog, had history of severe neglect from first owner and had issues of biting people, but now has improved greatly after being exposed to many people and animals. He never bites another animal unless they snap at him first, even then he's only ever nipped at them, not bite, otherwise he is just nosy and gets in other dogs business to sniff them up and down. Winston and Jeep got along amazingly from the first day I introduced them to each other, never got mean with one another and play constantly, they are like brothers at this point and have a decent sized back yard to run around in.

I have been wanting to adopt a female German shepherd/husky mix puppy and was wanting some advice on how I should go about introducing them to my boys, will they try to compete with one another once she matures, will they possibly get into fights over her?

My dogs are mixed breeds, ~25 lbs. I'm currently mixing their kibble with the [canned versions of the lamb and chicken](https://www.amazon.com/13-2-Natures-Domain-Kirkland-Variety/dp/B07PLZQ2TR/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kirkland+lamb+chicken+dog+food&amp;qid=1615351443&amp;sr=8-1) and hoping to transition to 100% kibble (unless there's a good reason not to that I'm not aware of, my vet said it didn't matter).

The ingredients and nutritional profiles appear to be nearly identical aside from these minor differences:

* They both have a calcium supplement (calcium pantothenate) but only the chicken shows it on the guaranteed analysis (1% minimum).

* The chicken shows a 0.8% minimum for phosphorus while it doesn't appear at all on the lamb.

* Taurine is listed on the ingredients for the lamb and not on the chicken (maybe there's more of it naturally in the chicken? I don't know).

I'm sure there are more differences between the two that aren't shown on the label which is the insight I'm looking for. For example, [taurine and carnitine are important in preventing DCM](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17085238/) but the data provided doesn't show the levels of these in each nor does it show their amino acid profiles.

She has one small patch between her shoulders, so it looks like we caught it early. The vet prescribed one dose of Bravecto, which we‚Äôre giving her with dinner tonight. I‚Äôm also going to give her raw food (we usually do half kibble, half raw food) and coconut oil to soothe her skin.

He said demodectic mange is common in goldens and can be worsened by stress, colds, etc. We recently had a baby (stress) and Lucy had a cold a few weeks ago. He was surprised that she has it, though, because she‚Äôs young and otherwise healthy. 

But my crazed and sleep-deprived dog mom mind keeps worrying she has an underlying condition that‚Äôs weakening her immune system, like cancer or a thyroid issue. The vet said she looks super healthy and everything is fine systemically. 

Has anyone had a younger dog that was diagnosed with demodectic mange? What brought it on? Any insight/reassurance would be greatly appreciated!",4,1614280014

DogCare,lpluvy,sadtimesman,1,Limp/lame leg,"My dog (1 year 3 month old or so staffy/pit mix - or at least that's what I think) started limping around a month ago. I watched some videos on limping/lame legs and they suggested applying a small amount of pressure up and down the leg to see where they might react, but nothing gets her to react.

&amp;#x200B;

I took her to the vet (did a similar examination of the leg and couldn't see anything), and she suggested no off leash walks for 2 weeks, only short walks on lead. Which we did - but it's not clear if there's really been any progress. She's still clearly favouring the other leg. The vet also said if no improvements from there we could do x-rays and such. The only thing is that my dog doesn't seem phased by any of this, other than that she won't put much weight on that leg. For example if she jumps up on my lap and I push back on the ""bad"" leg - she'll just let it get pressed all the way back and the leg folds. If I press on the ""good"" leg, she pushes back on my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that she still loves going for walks, no change in mood/eating/anything else I can think of.

&amp;#x200B;

So the obvious answer is of course go back to the vet and see what happens. But I just wanted to ask the community generally speaking, should I be waiting longer or should I just go to the vet?",9,1613993461

She loves other dogs, not really interested in people except her owners. She is a big goof ball but would always play to the level of the other dog.. i.e. bigger dog she would rumble, smaller dogs she would lay down and play. 

After a few instances at the dog park we stopped going and I will just walk with her on a lead in the park. 
Dogs come up to her and the first thing I ask is ""is your dog friendly?"" The owners typically say yes and so I let them have a sniff. But what happens? The dog she is sniffing will turn around a get aggressive, growl and she has now been bitten again. 

I am thinking maybe her size is intimidating the other dogs as now she is 45kgs and still just a pup? I am not sure. 

I will say even time a dog has been aggressive to her I never 'react' i just calmly walk away and give het pats once we are out of site and play with her lots.. she doesn't seem too phased by it all and has never been aggressive back. 

I just don't want her to ever be fearful of other dogs but afraid if it keeps happening one day she might.

DogCare,lgzztr,knamb,1,Dog tears himself up when running in the backyard?,"Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right forum for my question but I hope so and apologize if not! My dog's absolutely favorite thing to do is run around in our large backyard of about an acre. He likes it maybe even more than his daily walks because he can tear around and go fast. But he keeps tearing himself up on who knows what. His legs have little scabs on them and he's also torn himself up enough once to need weekend stitches which was a nice $1200 out of my wallet. I have scoured the yard but there isn't anything that I could remove that might be the potential culprit (everything he runs over is part of permanent landscaping). We have tree wells which he runs on top of so it could be them but I can't really take those out. Anyway, he'd he absolutely miserable if I keep him inside and he's already always supervised in the backyard but I can't really stop him from running around and that would defeat the purpose. Even today he has a big scrape on his back leg that is missing hair and a little red. I was just hoping that someone might have some suggestions for something he could wear on his legs outside that would keep him safe or any other ideas at all that could allow him to do what he loves without getting injured. Thanks so much in advance for the help.

tldr: my dog scrapes up his legs when he runs in my backyard and I was wondering if there was something I could do to protect his legs while still letting him have fun.",21,1612981299

DogCare,lfu6k2,lovelydoomxx,1,Anxious dog? Please help. (tw: suicide),"I ‚Äúadopted‚Äù my recently deceased aunt‚Äôs dog, Koa. 

A little backstory- He was abused when he was a few months old (throw out of a truck window) and a family friend found him and my aunt took Koa under her wing. Also, he is neutered...My aunt committed suicide &amp; we believe that he heard the gun go off. So naturally, he‚Äôs more sensitive of loud noises.

He‚Äôs a year old, potty trained, etc. Follows basic commands. He stays outside most of the day playing with his brother Buddy &amp; sleeps inside in the living room. 

One morning, I went into the living room and Buddy had an accident + Koa chewed up the plastic piece on his collar that I took off one night. (I learned with this one.. or so I thought.) I even contributed it to maybe a stressful environment? 

The next day, I went to the store and when I came back, he tore up his leash. I bought him a hard plastic chew bone (thinking maybe he was still minor teething) &amp; Koa got to the point of chewing so much his gums started bleeding. 

My mom got him a hard plastic dog toy and he bit in it too much, eating the damn squeaker part. He‚Äôs still eating and I know to look out for obstructions, etc. 

I‚Äôve also noticed he continuously licks paws (I know this can be a self-soothing thing) and has been gnawing on his foot frequently. No thorns, no cuts or scrapes, no fleas or ticks. 

Each night, he has moments where his face twitches a little &amp; breathes a little hard. Maybe a nightmare? I call his name and gently pet him til he wakes and tell him it‚Äôs ok. 

I am aware my dog is a little anxious bc of his past circumstances but I‚Äôm reaching out to maybe hear some other inputs from experienced dog owners. The little guy has been through enough and I want to do the best I can for him. üê∂üêæ

he's around 90lbs and at a good weight, but I don't want to overfeed him with kongs and the like. he's not a fan of toys really, but does like to chew on hard plastic toys (until it gets to a point where it cuts his gums and I have to throw it out). he sometimes likes to chase this nerf dog toy I got him, but lately not so much.

other dogs also really scare him, so socialization and making doggy friends is out of the question for now. we do go on long daily walks so he gets out any energy there, and we do little training sessions that he enjoys solely because food is involved lol.

DogCare,l8bk60,MightyMouse916,1,HELP: Seeking insight on my puppy's ongoing soft stool.,"Hello Dog Care Community,

I have Letty, she is an 8 month old Great Dane weighing in at about 100lbs. I am at a loss on solving her soft stools üòï

Since I have had Letty from 10 weeks of age, she has had consistent soft stools and sometimes diarrhea. We kept her on the same chicken and rice food the breeder used for a few months (she had soft stools on this food) and then switched to a higher quality brand of Chicken &amp; Rice (NutriSource Large Breed Puppy). 

She has been screened by the vet twice for worms and other parasites and both came back clean. She has has 2 anal gland infections, which we think is due to the soft stools. She has been on two different antibiotics for the anal gland infections and each time she is on them, her stool is the best it has ever been. They are firm, formed, and easy to clean up. A day or two after she finishes her antibiotics her soft stools return. Often, in a single potty session her stool starts formed (still not firm) and then becomes less firmed and almost liquid consistency. I should note that after completing her antibiotics, I give her probiotics. The first probiotic that she was on for months was Nusentia Probiotic Miracle and after this most recent round of antibiotics, I tried Purina Fortiflora. The first day on the Fortiflora I heard gassy noise in her tummy. Since her second anal gland infection, I also was putting 3 tablespoons of plain pumpkin puree in her food. I had also put her on a bland boiled chicken breast and rice diet and she did fine on this, she actually didn't poop much because she was absorbing most of it. The nutritionist that we get her food from said many dogs have an intolerance to chicken  and that could be the cause of our loose stool problem so then I switched to boiled lean ground beef and rice and she also did fine with this and hardly pooped. Then, we slowly switched to a Victor's beef and rice kibble while she was still on her antibiotics and she did great, until she went off antibiotics and we started the Fortiflora probiotics. Even after 2 weeks of finishing antibiotics, her stools remain soft and smelly. 

 Her main daily treats are 1-2 large carrots , 1 apple slice, 1 small Mother Hubbard peanut butter buscuit, and the occasional Instinct Pumpkin Gut Heath meal mixer. I also put warm water in her kibble. 

The recommendation from the owner at the pet food nutrition store we buy her food from is to go back to bland boiled beef and rice for a couple days and try Honest Kitchen Perfect Form and slowly switch back to the NutriSource brand, but instead a fish protein because it's easier on the digestive tract and to get the adult formula because it will be lower protein and fat levels which is easier on the stomach. She also suggested I stop the pumpkin puree and probiotics for now. What are your thoughts on these recommendations? 

Thank you for any and all insight! Figuring out digestive issues can be challenging to pinpoint and I just want my pup to be happy and healthy üíú",5,1611973778

Kirkland lamb and rice -&gt; Was doing very good for almost a year, then he is no longer tolerating it. If  he takes it for more than a week, he will  start having very bad diarrhea. It seems like he has built  an intolerance to this exact food.

Raw food commercial mix (lamb and fish base) -&gt; This is where we are today, he just got an ear infections, once again it might be our fault (we didn't do ear cleaning well this month) on this one but he never had this bad an ear infections. overall scratching is much better.

Yesterday evening, our dog started hiding under the bed ‚Äî something she absolutely never does. She looked scared and stressed. Her ears were flat against her head, and she was lip licking and yawning a ton. She went under the bed around 5pm, and her last walk was at 3pm. 

To get her outside to pee at night, we had to lure her with cheese and then she went right back under the bed when we got in. She came out to get in our bed with us to sleep. This morning, she woke up with us and seemed back to normal. 

Then, when we went to put her leash on to take her out, she went back to looking scared and trying to get under the bed. We had to physically pick her up (she weighs 50 lbs) and carry her out to pee. Then we had to carry her back in. She went straight back under the bed the second we got back inside. Absolutely nothing has happened or changed in her life in the last 24 hours ‚Äî we‚Äôre with her pretty much every second of the day, and she‚Äôs always on leash when we take her out.

# About My Dog

**Breed:** Miniature Schnauzer

**Gender:** Female

**Age:** 9 (Turning 10 this year)

**Neuter Status:** Spayed

**Weight:** 14 lbs (don't remember specifically)

**Past History:** Heart Murmur diagnosis a few years ago

**Vaccinations:** All done (they'e a year overdue but pet places have told me it's not a huge deal)

**Environment:** House-raised, never really mingled with other dogs; non-smoking home

**Habits:** Eats rabbit poo and random stuff in our yard sometimes

My dog started heaving on/off since yesterday, coughing but with nothing coming out -- she puked out saliva a few times but that was it. I grew concerned and took her to a vet this morning. I am aware that she has a heart murmur and was told a few years ago it was maybe a 3 on a scale of 6 for severity, but was told today after an x-ray that my dog is at 4/5 out of 6. The vet who had made the initial diagnosis had said it wasn't something to stress or worry too much about (but to monitor for signs of worsening), but the vet today told me my dog's murmur has enlarged her heart valves and unfortunately, has now brought on mitral valve disease. She said the heaving my dog was doing was likely due to the disease. We were given 4 medications for her to now take, 3 of which she will have to take for life, one of which is a doxycycline for a week just to kill any bacteria that may be inside.

There's no guarantee this medicine will stop the heaving my dog's been doing. But I've just been so broken, having to hear and see her heave like that and cough with no solution to it. She has never heaved like this before, but the vet said this just may have been something that developed over time and just surfaced in terms of symptoms. She said dogs don't heave like this out of nowhere for an overnight reason, and usually do so due to something chronic. The vet confirmed my dog had nothing stuck in her trachea or lungs.

The vet did a comprehensive blood panel today, the results for which I am waiting on. It was done just to check for other possible issues, but also because my dog pooed out gooey red discharge randomly last Monday, and the week prior to that, had unexplained diarrhea and vomited a few times. The vet said the bloodwork can maybe see if there are any infections.

I was told the medicine obviously cannot stop her murmur or fully make this heaving go away, but I just don't know what I should do.

DogCare,l2g9fh,weeshy56,1,Kibble &amp; Farmers Dog,"Hi everyone :) I have a 10 month old 25lb Beagle mix named Maple. I rescued her on Dec 22 and have been feeding her Hills since that‚Äôs what the shelter was using for the couple weeks (ish) that she was there. 
I‚Äôve started to notice within the past few days that she is becoming more picky with her food and not finishing her bowl during mealtimes (which she used to do). I don‚Äôt want to let her start grazing because having a routine seems to be the best for me and her. I‚Äôve had her eating from a puzzle bowl for majority of the time i‚Äôve had her now and she seems to really enjoy that. 

Today at dinner I wanted to test out a theory if she was actually picky or not so I bought a can of Hills wet food for her and mixed it in with her dry kibble. Man did she LOVE that. I was asking for some advice if I should start doing half kibble half Farmers dog fresh food for her. 

My vet said that kibble is totally fine for her diet since it is very good for their teeth and energy. I take her on two walks a day but would rather help the pickiness from the start rather than have more troubles later down the road. 

I appreciate the advice and would love to hear some suggestions :) thank you!!!",9,1611290646

I understand that puppies do tend to have loose stool from time to time. But this little guy is different.

For the last three to four days, his stool has been inconsistent. The reason why I‚Äôm asking about this, and not rushing him to a vet is because he is eating and drinking, energy levels are beyond fine (crazy puppy energy) and he just had his second round of shots yesterday where the vet said he was a healthy weight.

When he poops, it‚Äôs coming out as diarrhea and mucus. The stool is normal in colour, but the mucus is yellow. We turned him over to a rice and egg diet as suggested by our yet, and his poop solidified up for the next two, but this morning, it was back to liquid and mucus. 

Again, just to reiterate, he is eating and drinking fine, energy levels are amazing (currently chasing a ball around the house as I‚Äôm writing this) and no signs of general concern to my knowledge.

My sweet Snorkie (schnauzer/yorkie mix) is an aggressive chewer.

The only thing that we‚Äôve found he can‚Äôt damage or destroy are fake (but edible) bones, and I have an issue with that because I worry about his teeth. If he didn‚Äôt chew constantly maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be as hesitant to give him a bone, but if he doesn‚Äôt have anything for himself he will find one of my younger sister‚Äôs toys or a stuffed animal to chew on.

DogCare,ksiiwk,JPJS1515,1,Dog suddenly jumps up out dead sleep and runs away.....(senior dog),"Hi, 

Wondering if anyone has any clues or helpful info for us. We've been to the vet, chatted with them, discussed a multitude of issues, had complete blood panel done (everything looked great), but I just cannot seem to get whatever is going on with my dog under control. This is what she does - she will be sound asleep (she does this during the day and at night), and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere leaps or jumps up from her sleep as if something bit her or is attacking her. She might stand near the bed or run out into the hallway and just kind of stare into the distance. She might look at her butt. She will even sometimes go back to her bed or the couch where she was and sniff around. Sometimes she's scared to go back to her bed because it's as if she associating the bed with the thing that bit her or made her jump up. 

The first thought the vet and I had back in Dec 2020 was, anal glands. We expressed those on Dec 1. I do think that it helped lessen the frequency with which she does this, but it did not eliminate it entirely. Could she really need to have her glands expressed again so soon? or could this be something else? Vet mentioned it very well may be anxiety or canine cognitive decline....which I really, really hope is not the case. 

She is 11 years old in March - and definitely does have a sensitive stomach, so we are super careful about what we give her. She has been farting quite a bit more over the last year too (we figure digestion slowing down, old age, etc.), and the farts are usually non-smelly, though sometimes there will be a stinky one and it's bad but not awful. I figure that she is farting and the fart is what makes her jump up, etc. Currently experimenting with some limited ingredient dog food from the brand we feed her (we feed her Nulo); she has been on Nulo senior for about 2 years and has done relatively well on that until the last 6 months or so. 

I don't know. I am just exhausted from no sleep as she wakes me up 5+ times a night these days. Any help is so greatly appreciated at this point.",0,1610041941

DogCare,kjul7w,dmfke7g,1,Change in Behavior at Night,"So over the last three days my dog no longer follows commands once it gets around the time we normally go to bed. He's about 2 and a half years old. Two nights ago we slept in the living room since this was so out the the ordinary  for him; last night, he alternated between sleeping on his bed in my room, and sleeping just outside my door in the hallway. Normally he'll start in my bed and go to his bed and back to mine depending on his mood that night between 0-2 times, but never before has he refused the ""Sleep,"" command. When I give him the command he'll pretend he doesn't hear me and then attempts to leaves the area  He'll stop and begrudgingly go to bed if I give the knock it off command, ""uh-ba-bah.""  He's timid with taking treats at night now once, which is concerning since he's part beagle and always looking for food. I did notice some new black on one side of one of his nails, but besides that, there's no visible signs or behavioral cues that would indicate an infection/disease issue, (he can be quite careless when he digs, so this isn't the first time that one of his nails became partly black.  Previously, this  sleep command refusal happened over a two-day period about 6 months ago when he was having issues controlling the expression of his anal glands. There isn't any visible issues or an leaking of any kind this time around.  Ears are clean and not sensitive to touch. There's no swelling of the abdominal region and he's eating/drinking normally.  I did notice a tiny bit of build up on his teeth, though they weren't sensitive to my probing, and I am planning to take him in for a dental cleaning at the beginning of January. I've run through the normal checklist and I'm just out of reasons for the behavioral change, (reasons include: removing any strong smells like my oil plug ins, and making sure there isn't noise beyond the normal range, and normal medical checks (He normally requires a fan running in the background if he's having trouble staying put)). He did whack his tail pretty hard the other day against the wall when he was excited when I came home but he's using it, just not as much as before (Again, only at night). He'll let me touch and move it with no signs of  discomfort. I'm just at a loss for why the sudden change and why only at night. Since I've had him I have slept in two different rooms across the hall from each other, but neither one is giving me better results since the issue popped up. He's perfectly fine being in the bed if I don't sit/lay down or if I haven't commanded him to sleep, but as soon as I touch the bed he wants to get up and leaves, then only to plop down right in the doorway. Any other possibilities on why the sudden change in behavior would be greatly appreciated.",3,1608878112

He has had a bout with pancreatitis since the start of the year. He‚Äôs 16 years old and earlier in the year he was hospitalized for a couple of days. 

I had to take him in last Saturday and the cost is astronomical. Usually, I pay for it without batting an eye but this time for his card it cost me $1k. 

My doctor is advising I take him in for 3 days and overnight stay, which for someone who got furloughed Is a bit expensive. 

My question is, I have his meds and he seems to be responding. He‚Äôs eating some food, but water is where he doesn‚Äôt seem to go for. He drinks maybe at beat twice a day. 

I was told giving him water with a dropper is a good alternative to an IV drip in a hospital and a $3k bill. 
He responded to it well yesterday, seemed to be bouncier. I didn‚Äôt give him much water today. (Busy with some minor work stuff) and he seems lethargic. 

He‚Äôs stool was black and tarry and now seems to be more brown. He‚Äôs no longer throwing up which is good. I‚Äôm back to giving him droplets of water at top of the hour and will add pedialite.

DogCare,kfpsht,laydeehey,1,"Signs of old age in dog, or something else? first time owner","hello fellow dog parents!

context: i have a terrier, chow and staffordshire bull mix, roughly between the ages of 7-8. i was his foster mom back in Jan 2019, adopted him 2months later. been together since! he always had white around his muzzle, and now it's covering most of his coat 

i cant tell if pandemic life has been causing a lot of stress/boredom for him (plus i stopped letting him play with neighborhood dogs cause of the bias), or if this is old age behavior and he's been getting soooo finicky, and often reverting to some puppy-like behavior.

examples:
- only eating when i do instead of his usual self motivation. i know this could be pack behavior but it makes having consistency hard. i have a chronic condition that makes my appetite flux pretty bad, along with active joint pain, and it's worse in Midwest winters.

- not eating, despite having a bowl of food his LIKES, then begging for food, attention, etc. i'm regular about the same feeding time, and he'll just... ignore it. some days he'll enjoy his food in a toy feeder, others days no. 

- forgetting/avoiding some commands. i try to build training as play time and it might be getting old? i do it at the same time to let him know i'm done with work.

- intense velcro behavior. following me EVERYWHERE in the apartment, high alert when i leave the room, that sort of thing. he was always a nervous kinda dog but it's been...moreso. he was returned to the shelter twice before i fostered him. i sing in the apt to have to let him know i haven't gone anywhere.

- not actually wanting to play when i initiate it, again at the same time each night. different toys, but not much happens cause he doesn't like any of them! he does likes taking squeakers out of toys but that's about it. i also try to train/teach him to play fetch to build command recall, but he's never taking to it well.

- i try to tire him out on our walks (2x-3x a day), taking different routes each time, but he'll refuse to walk for long some days, then gets AMPED when we're inside. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but he surprised me this morning with an hour walk! part of it is the temp, but even with his dog coat, mixed messages are often.

it's just me taking care of him, and honestly between work and health stress, i'm finding myself getting frustrated and impatient with him, which i KNOW doesn't help. he's never behaved like this before and it's now another worry on my plate, and it's triggering bad pet parent guilt. am i too rigid? too flexible? the one giving mixed messages?

any and all advice would be great! i'm waiting to see if i need to take him to the vet, or if this will pass once i understand what's happening.  photo for reference!",6,1608313424
DogCare,kfkbwi,2073Lola,7,Food change resulting in major decrease peeing and pooping,"Hi! We recently transitioned our 4 yo mixed breed to a different food at the urging of our vet. The reason was because our pup unfortunately fell victim to DCM from a grain free diet (Wellness Brand). She has not seen the cardiologist yet due to COVID and limitations in our geographic location. 

For the last 3-4 weeks, she is now on Natural Balance LID, WITH grains (duck protein and brown rice) and also 1500mg taurine, 1500mg L-carnitine, and 2000 ug‚Äôs of B12 supplementation daily. 

Her medical history is further complicated by well controlled EPI which she‚Äôs been on enzymes now for over 2 years with good stools while on Wellness Brand Grain-Free Wild Game.

She tolerated the change in food very well. But since we have changed her food, she is peeing maybe twice per day (still normal volumes, just much less frequent), and pooping very little (only once per day and much smaller volume). 

On her old food, she had 2-3 poops per day and peed easily 3-4 times per day in addition to hiking her leg to mark (yes she‚Äôs weird like that). 

I called our vet and he said to continue the supplements, but I‚Äôm a little worried about her kidney function due to decreased urine output. And also is it weird for my EPI dog to go from frequent, sizable poops with good consistency to pooping maybe 2-3 poop nuggets per day?",7,1608294873

Of course under normal circumstances, I would have schedule an appointment right away. Unfortunately, earlier this year, my dog had ITP and was in the ICU for 5 days. He's currently taking medication (prednisone and cyclosporine) and his specialist mentioned that it would be dangerous to put him under anesthesia. Now this his prednisone dosage is very low, the specialist believes that he'll be OK.

I plan on getting his teeth cleaned/extracted but can anyone please tell me what the bumps are?

Surgery: She would be in a cast for 8-12 weeks, with a weekly visit to vet for cast cleanings/changes. She has to be on the leash almost at all times. Then once she is out of the cast then a few more months of rebuilding her strength/rehab.

Being that she is up there in age, do I take away half a year of her being in a cast/rehabbing?

Everything was fine over the first few days, but around the 4th day, she started to bark at the other dogs on walks. It's not just barking, but growling and jumping like she is going to kill them.

DogCare,k8dip4,srcare,1,Parents' Dog with Broken Tail,"Hello everyone,

My parents rescued a cute lil cockapoo-mutt who has really warmed to them, and is overall a very happy dog now. He'll generally let you pet anywhere, but gets very protective if you touch or go near his tail. He gets sad and tries to cover it with his body. It seems like his past owner must have abused him and broken his tail. I was wondering if there was a chance there could be lasting pain, or if it's likely to be psychological trauma. If there's a chance it did not heal properly does anyone have any ideas for treatment? Right now it's hard to justify taking X-rays and the like, because he's always in high spirits as long as you avoid his tail.

Thanks!",6,1607333409

DogCare,k7oha0,MaliciousMal,1,Looking to get some advice on how to introduce my 2 older dogs to my 2 new pups.,"Okay so as the title says - my sister went and got 2 pups, both female, a few days ago. I already have another pup who's about 1 1/2 years already and my other dog is about 5 or 6, both are male. Now here's the thing, we've been trying to introduce the 4 to each other and we've had no success. 

I tried earlier and the puppies decided to start barking, this scared the hell out of my dogs and so the older one started to growl (but he wasn't trying to be aggressive, he was just trying to say ""Hey, I'm bigger, you should fear me!"" as he was cowering in my arms) which led to the other boy to start growling (he doesn't understand and just follows the older one's lead, thankfully he doesn't bark). My boys aren't usually aggressive and are easily scared or intimidated by other dogs (though oddly enough they're friendly with our neighbors pup which is a German Shepard but they only ever see each other through the fence). 

I'm hoping this is the right place because I don't know what to do. I want all of them to get to know each other but I've no real experience with this sort of thing because growing up I only ever really had like 1 or 2 dogs at a time. The girls are only a couple months old and we put them in a cage to sleep at night so that way they don't make a mess on the carpets in the rooms, this way our other dogs can come into the house during the night to sleep since it gets cold.

He has suddenly become a lot more skeptical of strangers, even my other room mate's boyfriend who comes over almost every day. He'll bark viciously and is clearly very afraid whenever he sees someone he views as a threat. I used to walk Blue off a leash around our apartment complex because he used to be very well behaved (Bad idea, I know that now) but now he runs up to people he sees on the sidewalk, even from a distance, and growls and barks at them like they're killing his owner. 

Recently Blue had a very traumatic event with an old room mate who moved out. She brought over five or so friends who basically squatted here for a week straight (BELIEVE ME I TRIED EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE THEM GTFO) and they would scream at him, taunt him, and hit and shake his cage. His owner basically moved into her boyfriends house for a few days and left him here the whole time. She claimed he would be 'uncomfortable' at her boyfriend's house because 'this is his home'. I'e talked to her about his sudden attitude change but she claims its all normal because he just 'does that sometimes.' I'm extremely worried because my other room mate is worried that Blue will bite her boyfriend, and I'm becoming worried too. Usually he's such a sweet dog, and its horrible seeing him so upset all the time.

Vet isn‚Äôt sure what is going on yet. Wondering what could be happening, and if it‚Äôs safe to stop quarantining the dog.


I adopted a 3 year old Chihuahua, Bennie, back in July. She‚Äôs had some skin issues from the start‚Äîshe get little scabby bits around the edges of her ears, but they don‚Äôt cause her any pain or itching and with daily cleaning that hasn‚Äôt been an issue. She also has chronic liver disease that we manage with diet and supplements.

A little over a month ago, my roommate and I both realized we had ringworm (or something that looked and acted exactly like it) in our armpits. Upon looking at Bennie, I noticed she was having some hair loss around her chest and her armpits seemed to be irritated. 

I took her to the vet, they gave her an antibiotic injection and took a culture. A week later they said the ringworm came back negative. I thought this was weird since both my roommate and I were successfully treating our rashes with OTC ringworm cream. Vet gave her a chlorhexidine mousse and shampoo, been using them daily and baths every few days. 

I brought Bennie back to the vet a week ago and they did another test and gave her a Cytopoint injection because she‚Äôs been really itchy (rubbing up on furniture and scratching all over a lot). 

Today the vet called and said her second test was negative. Now I‚Äôm at a loss. Vet said to keep on it with the baths and mousse and check back in in a week, they can order a full bloodwork if needed. Said it could be allergies but they‚Äôre just not sure.

I just have no clue what to do. I had been isolating her and not cuddling her and washing all bedding etc and now I wonder if that was for nothing? But how can both my roommate and I have ringworm of unknown origin and a dog with ringworm symptoms but no ringworm? 

I‚Äôve done lots of googling, I don‚Äôt think she has mange but that‚Äôs a possibility. She doesn‚Äôt have any major spots of irritation right now but she‚Äôs still losing a lot of hair. The injection seems to have helped with the itching, I‚Äôve noticed she hasn‚Äôt been doing it as much. 

If this is just allergies would it be safe for me to let her cuddle with us on the couch again? Or should I continue to assume the worst and quarantine her as much as possible? 

Does anyone have any experience with something like this or advice?",7,1606944413

DogCare,jvrs8t,CrazedArea,5,Thoughts on dogs hive breakouts,"Since I got Aria about a year ago she‚Äôs had skin problems. She breaks out in hives every so often but does not seem to bothered by them. I thought it was a dairy allergy so I eliminated dairy but she still got them. I went to the vet twice about it and the first time they suggested 2 fish oil pills and 1 Zyrtec pill daily. I did this for a while but she‚Äôd still break out 1-2 times per month. I switched vets for an unrelated reason and brought her the second time to be seen by her new vet. She said it was likely an allergic reaction and prescribed prednisone to help clear it up. They kept coming and going so I finally decided to try and elimination diet to see if it is something she is eating. About 1.5 weeks ago Aria started on Royal Canin Selected Protein WP diet. I noticed her stools seemed healthier (not as runny and lighter colored). She really enjoys the food but of course it‚Äôs expensive which I don‚Äôt mind if it helps solve this mystery. As she was transitioning to the new food she had another breakout. It started with a few bumps but became worse than ever the next day and this time she seemed irritated by them. They were mostly located near the top of her back (closer to her neck) than other times when they‚Äôre evenly spread out down her back. The vet prescribed prednisone and they cleared up within 1-2 days. She still had a lot of dry flaky skin and scabs from recovering. I thought she was getting better but this morning she woke up with all the hives again (mostly located on her upper back again). She is on her new food and getting no other food than the selected protein. I also stopped giving her Zyrtec but continued with fish oil. 

I am not sure if this is a different kind of reaction (since it‚Äôs located on her upper back) or if I can rule out a food allergy. I tried to think of things she came into contact with after each of the last two break outs but they don‚Äôt align. The second to last breakout I was in cape cod and she had no interactions with other dogs. I did use cleaning products around the house  which I thought maybe could have caused it because it was the only different thing she was exposed to. The most recent breakout we were back home. I gave her a bath two days before with the same oatmeal shampoo as always. The previous day she was at the dog park (which we do every morning) and later on in the day she rolled around in the grass in my backyard. 

I feel really stumped and am going to call the vet when they open today. I feel like their are so many possibilities and it‚Äôs frustrating. I just want her to have a healthy, shiny coat.

DogCare,ju9p9l,TimeFourChanges,1,Dog that seemingly only chews plush things,"Hi, all. I got a mixed breed, hound and lab, pup about 6 weeks ago. She was about 7 months old and arrived with zero training. She's given me fits from the beginning, as she seemingly always wants to do the opposite of what I'd like. We're making improvements, but lately she's driving me insane by seemingly only wanting to chew on plush type things: She destroyed her dog which had a fluffy ring around the outside, and then yesterday annihilated a pillow. I have provided her a wealth of chew toys. Just available to her at present, there's: a knotted rope, another rope that's intertwined with rope and rubber, a squeaky plush bone, a squeaky fish that's more nylon type material, some bone pieces wrapped around a bone, and a hard plastic two-handled toy. Many of these she's spent some time with, but nonetheless chooses to chew things she shouldn't. 

What should I do? If I get her a stuffy toy, it'll be dead in minutes. I see there's sprays to deter chewing on specific things, so I'm assuming I should get that? Are there sprays to make her current toys more appealing? Are there toys that would give her the same enjoyment as her bed and my pillows, which won't disintegrate in minutes?

Would really appreciate the help because I'm doing my best with the girl, but she's repeatedly doing crap that's irking my soul. Thanks!",9,1605389324

DogCare,jo0tz6,imonredditokiedokie,1,Hoping for Advice - Young Rescue Dog and Seizures/Seizure Meds,"Hi everyone,

In early September, my partner and I rescued a 3-year old shepherd mix. She's super sweet, super high energy, and has had a lot of attachment anxiety. Last Thursday, she suddenly started having small seizures. She was having jaw convulsions with tongue chewing and her eyes were going blank. In between seizures, she was totally and completely exhausted. We rushed her to the vet after the first one, and she continued having them the rest of the day. 

Our vet put her on two seizure meds and an antibiotic in case the cause was a tick-borne illness. While she has not had any more seizures, she has been totally and completely knocked out by these meds. She sleeps all day, and she's super unstable on her feet and falls a lot while walking. This is obviously not sustainable. 

Because she is so young, and because these seizures started out of the blue, I'm wondering if we should try to take her off the meds completely (under the guidance of our vet, of course) and see what happens...if they don't come back. Has anyone else had experience with young dogs having small seizures? 

Also, we gave her her Nexgaurd heartworm medication on Tuesday, and the seizures started on Thursday. I've read that seizures are a reported adverse event with Nexgaurd. Wondering if anyone has any experience with this either? We've asked a couple vets who didn't take this super seriously...

Any advice anyone could offer would be much appreciated. She is our first dog and we are completely and totally in love and obsessed. We want her to be healthy and happy, and get her back to her old high-energy, playful self.",8,1604510836

DogCare,jmzdd0,Coorion,1,To the people with multiple dogs..,"Is it normal to not have a close bond with one of your dogs? I feel that way with my 17 year old Rat Terrier. 

A family member rescued her when she was a few years old, she was at a shelter about to be put down that day. She was extremely overweight, horrid dental disease and had a bite history - nobody wanted her. She was eventually pawned off on me while I was just a high school student due to some unfortunate events. I already had a dog and I had gotten a puppy around the same time.

Fast forward 7 years to now - we got a puppy 3 years ago, lost my other old girl 2 years ago and my other little guy is now 7yrs old. 

I have always given my dogs everything they want and need and my two boys are the world to me and my boyfriend. But my old girl just doesn't fit in. She is possessive and will attack me, my dogs, cats, and pretty much anyone if she doesn't get what she wants (mostly food related). I have still always tried to make accommodations to avoid these situations but it still happens. She will then proceed to pee on my bed or couch in what seems like out of spite. Constantly getting into things and trying to attack me when I discover her doing whatever it is she's doing.

She loves me but it seems like she just turns off this switch and becomes a completely different dog.

I'm trying everything I can to make her as comfortable as possible in her old age, she hallways even slept in bed with me. She can be so sweet and all my friends love her but she is a secret terror. I love her but that bond that I feel with my other dogs, even my cat, just isn't there. 

I have tried training and even consulting a trainer. Nothing helps. My other two I've been able to successfully train and they are amazingly obedient and loyal, but I had them since they were puppies.

The thought of rehoming her when she was younger did cross my mind but I could never bring myself to do that, only because I don't think anyone else would be so patient with her.

Does this make me a horrible dog mom? Did I mess up during my years of having her? Could I have done more? I feel defeated by her and starting to feel guilty now that she's so old and I probably don't have much time left with her.",0,1604361163

I'm not here to vent... I love my dog to death. I rescued him from a former aggressive owner who kept him in a kennel for 12 hrs a day in his first 1.5 of life. 

So let's cut to the chase. He's 6.5 years old now. Lately, he's developing very strange behavior, where whenever we would give him love and affection, he would accept it for a few seconds then be all dodgy and corners himself away from us. He would also bark at us when it's time to eat.

When we walk outside, he usually poops 2x a day, but lately, it has been 3 if not 4x A TRIP. I don't know what is wrong with this guy. The more he behaves like this the more annoyed I get. I try to hold my temper and such, and with other things going on with my life he's been stressing me out. 

How do I control my 6.5 year old dog? He's been a super anxious dog all his life. I even have had anxiety bringing him to the vet because he's out of control. Does anyone have experience with feeding their dog CDB treats? I need some advice... Thank you.",7,1604331515

It would also seem pointless since they are just too many. Is there some kind of natural substance that can drive frogs away or at least prevent them from getting close to my puppies?

My parents say I shouldn't worry but I still feel like it's a real threat. Maybe it's just my  ranidaphobia but what do you guys think?",5,1602949425

DogCare,jbwooh,rdmika,1,Rug/foam mat for dog with epilepsy?,"Hello! I'll try to make this quick, as it's probably a weird question and might not get any responses- that's fine, I just thought I'd try. I got a dog a month ago, found out she has epilepsy. Has had two seizures in the time I've had her and just started medication. When I'm gone, she's okay in her crate but I would prefer to leave her out during the day because she is extremely well behaved- she doesn't get into anything EVER and just likes to sleep on the bed or sunbathe on the floor while I'm gone. 

My problem is I'm very concerned about her having a seizure while I'm gone and falling off the bed and hurting herself. My bed isn't THAT high but she's a little dog and the floor of my apartment is literally just concrete, and the first seizure I saw her have was very convulsive- she was on the bed when it happened and would have fallen off the bed and directly onto her head if I hadn't of caught her. 

I have no interest in her not being allowed on the bed, and I really want to avoid getting a new bed (I just bought this one in March). Currently we're sleeping on the mattress on the floor until I figure something out. 

For my peace of mind and her safety, I was thinking of getting a thick rug or foam mat to put beside the bed. I really just want something to soften her fall if she ends up falling on her head off the mattress. Has anyone else dealt with this and have suggestions? Am I overreacting about the idea that she could land on her head?",1,1602797201

DogCare,j9b1h9,Star_Dog,1,Newly-adopted 5 year old having intermittent diarrhea/straining,"We adopted a wonderful beagle/corgi mix (estimated to be about 5 years old) about 3 weeks ago and so far everything has been great! However, over the past few days she has been having some diarrhea and we're wondering how concerned we should be. The details:

* Friday morning she woke us up at 4:30am, we took her outside where she did a mostly normal poop but there was some liquid at the end

* Sunday morning (today) she did the same thing again, had to go out around 4am and did a poop with some diarrhea at the end

* In between these she has had pretty normal bowel movements, although just one big one a day whereas before she sometimes did 2

* Just took her on a walk and she was straining a bit, then eventually just had some diarrhea and nothing solid

We've kept her diet consistent with what the shelter was giving her. The only change has been adding a spoonful of pumpkin starting on Friday. We also started adding an additive to her water Friday evening, but she'd already had diarrhea before that so I don't think that's the cause. She doesn't drink a ton of water in general but we haven't noticed any decrease in her thirst. She doesn't seem to be in pain or distress.

We do have a vet appointment booked in about a week (soonest we could get in) but we're wondering if this is something more urgent?",3,1602442305

SOURCE:
Source reported as lateral lumbar area-four unlabeled slides examined
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The first and second smears have a moderately basophilic background 
suggestive of proteinaceous fluid or material and contains abundant 
peripheral blood, several thick aggregates of ruptured cells that 
cannot be further evaluated and frequent ruptured cells. Better 
preserved cells consist of low numbers of highly granulated mast cells 
found scattered and occasionally in aggregates, low numbers of 
non-degenerate neutrophils and low numbers of eosinophils with few 
spindle cells. The remaining two smears are highly cellular with good 
preservation of cell morphology. They have a variably basophilic 
background and contain small amounts of peripheral blood and moderate 
amounts of lysed cellular debris. They contain many eosinophils, 
moderate to many non-degenerate neutrophils, low numbers of scattered 
well-differentiated mast cells, and low numbers of spindle cells 
compatible with reactive fibroblasts, with few macrophages. Obvious 
infectious agents are not detected but the amount of amorphous 
particulate matter and lysed cellular debris hampers the search for 
organisms.
MICROSCOPIC FINDINGS:
Highly suspicious for an inflamed mast cell tumor-please see comments
COMMENTS:
In the less cellular smears, occasional aggregates of mast cells are
seen, raising suspicions for a mast cell tumor, but in the more
cellular smears eosinophils far outnumber mast cells. Findings are
suspicious for a mast cell tumor particularly if the mass has been
present for a while. However if the mass arose acutely or clinically
you are not suspicious of a mast cell tumor than an area of allergic
hypersensitivity secondary to an insect bite or spider bite or an
inflamed eosinophilic granuloma cannot be excluded. Correlate with
your clinical impression. If clinically you suspect a mast cell tumor
than staging and excisional biopsy with histopathology is recommended.",5,1602027946

DogCare,ix2kll,simoraad,1,The things humans do that stress our dogs," When  we love our dogs as a family, we sometimes forget that they don't quite  understand us like our human relatives. Sometimes we try to have full  conversations with them or we unknowingly send them signals of body  language that are interpreted differently in the animal kingdom. For  these reasons, we have compiled a list of 9 things that humans do  routinely and that stress dogs.

**1. Getting frustrated when your dog acts like‚Ä¶a dog!**

Dogs  bark, dig, chew, sniff and steal table scraps that are within snout  range. For them, it's a natural behavior! (Also, they don't understand  the value of your favorite pair of shoes.) This does not mean that your  dog should have the freedom to do what he wants. Instead of punishing  these behaviours, we need to redirect them - and it takes patience! Vet  Street suggests alternatives such as giving stuffed Kongs to gnawing at  the jaws or teaching barkers to use their ""inner voice"".

**2.  Having inconsistent rules and boundaries**

Dogs  feed on consistency and routine, and feel comfortable there. If your  puppy is allowed to stay on the couch for a week and then scolded the  following week, he will be stressed when he cannot anticipate your  reaction to his behaviour. He won't understand if one night you decide  to ""let it pass"" or if you allow him to break the rules for a ""special  occasion"". When you create limits, stick to them!

**3. Expecting your dog to obey you just because they want to make you happy**

While  our dogs love to see us happy, they are still animals and opportunists  (for example, if they see an opportunity to snatch leftover chicken from  the counter, they will usually seize it!) Some dogs obey their owner  simply to please them, but most of them behave for a simple reason: to  receive their reward! Vet Street explains that an inconsistent reward  will most likely lead to inconsistent behavior. And you can't be mad at  your dog for not obeying if he can't expect to receive a reward in  return.

**4. Using multiple verbal cues to indicate the same behavior**

This  habit can be hard to lose! Say your dog barks at the postman, so you  say ""shut up!"" ""stop!"" and ""silence."" You gave him three different  orders that are supposed to mean the same thing: stop barking! Your dog  gets confused so he keeps barking and ends up getting scolded - but he  doesn't know why! It's best to find specific words to apply to each turn  or order, and make sure that all members of your family are on the same  page. If you use the word ""down"" for ""lay down,"" you may need to use  something like ""floor"" to tell your puppy to get out of bed!

**5. Saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù when your dog thinks it‚Äôs not**

When  our dogs are anxious, we want to comfort them. Often saying ""it's good""  in a soothing tone is our natural human reaction. But according to  Healthy Pets (via Mercola), we lead them to think otherwise. If we use  the phrase in conjunction with an act they don't like - for example,  take them to the vet or try to cut their nails - they learn to associate  expression with things that are wrong! If ""it's okay"" means that  something bad is about to happen, it can really stress your dog!

**6. Pointing or shaking a finger at them**

Healthy  Pets explains that this gesture is a ‚Äúuniversal stress inducer for  dogs.‚Äù The article says that it is often accompanied with an angry  gesture, a hovering stance, and a stern tone. Your pup may not remember  when he did to deserve the ‚Äúfinger point,‚Äù but he will know that you‚Äôre  upset with him, causing anxiety.

I've been to the vet several times for his itchiness and they haven't found anything definitive. Gave him antibiotics, steroids, anti-itch shampoo weekly, and lastly a cytopoint injection.

The itchiness was drastically improved, especially after the cytopoint but he's developing these small spots of hair loss. The spots seem like built up dry skin that can be peeled off but the hair comes with it. It's interesting that the majority of these spots are only on his left side.

Macy basically shares a portion of our dinner... She has always been a fussy dog, if we give her rice and beef, she will have the beef and leave the rice aside. 

My problem with this fussy little dog is that she is getting really old, she‚Äôll be 15 this Dec and I don‚Äôt think human food is any good for her. We are her second owner and from what I know her previous owner feeds her regular dry dog food.

These 2 days, I try to set down her dog food for 30mins, take it away, and set it down again for 30mins, she seems to get it that this will be her only food but she only took 1/4 of her food.  

I have also tried coating the dog food with salmon oil (for pets) and heat it up, still she refuses to eat... 

She hasn‚Äôt been eating much in 2 days and I‚Äôm getting worried... I hate wasting food but this fussy little bitch has been wasting so much food these years and it is time I put my foot down and do something!

I have a 4 and a half month old border collie mix, we‚Äôve had him for about a month and a half and love him very much! When we adopted him the rescue said that some his siblings had been quite itchy to the point of having small bald spots, they went to the vet and the vet tested for common causes including fecal samples that all came back negative. They bathed them with a special shampoo and this seemed to fix the problem. He‚Äôs been an itchy guy from the start with us, and it‚Äôs definitely ramped up the past week or so. No bald spots but especially in the morning a lot of itching and gnawing basically all over his body, from back to ears to paws. We haven‚Äôt changed anything diet wise. I mentioned this to the vet during our check up and she agreed he was itchy after combing him and couldn‚Äôt find any fleas (he‚Äôs up to date on flea meds). She didn‚Äôt mention it again during the appointment. While getting a booster last week I asked about allergy tests and they said they don‚Äôt usually do them because usually turns out the pup is allergic to grass or something very common. They suggested giving him Benadryl, but I‚Äôd rather find the cause rather than just treat symptoms. I‚Äôve tried oatmeal baths with no luck, and I‚Äôve also started giving him Aller-immune bites by Zesty paws. I would love to know if you‚Äôve had experience with an itchy pup and if you have any ideas on how to help him! Thanks so much for reading.",5,1599140571

DogCare,iivw5k,the-BattleRages0n,1,My neighbour's dog had the back of its neck shaven. Is there a reason for this?,"I'd ask them myself, but I really don't get along with them. 

It's a simple, and probably stupid question, but here's some background for my doubt....

My front door neighbors have this [sweet kind german shepard called Kiki.](https://imgur.com/a/8BP6vTO) She's literally the sweetest dog I've ever met (pictures from a while ago, unrelated to the shaving).

We live in a kind of gated community, which has only both our houses, and the only people who give the dog any attention at all are me and the housekeeper who takes care of the terrain and both houses. She spends the day next to him while he works, and on weekends when he's not here, I usually spend some time with her myself.

The neighbors have other 4 dogs, all of which live inside the house, or in their backyard, but Kiki stays loose on the terrain, so she often spends the day around my house, or in my backyard. 

What I mean is that the dog is clearly neglected. When the housekeeper is not here, she clearly gets depressed, and when he returns every sunday evening, she's already joyful and playful even before he arrives. 

I have no proof at all of this, but I believe she might've been hurt or abused by them when she was young, since she's very suspicious and scared around most people, sometimes even me.

I'm not accusing my neighbors of anything; but this, along with other unrelated events, makes me believe they have some degree of psycopathy. 

Anyway... This morning I went to greet her, as I always do, and noticed the whole back of her neck was shaven. I've never had dogs before, so I'd like to know if this is normal, perhaps for some vet procedure? Or for a kind of flea product? I don't know.

If I didn't have a history with them, I'd probably disregard that, but knowing the history of neglect, and other issues I've had with them, it makes me worried she may be being abused somehow...",16,1598720396

The cone they gave us was WAY too large and so I got her a slightly smaller one that still wouldn't let her touch the eye. Her stitches came undone I'm guessing after she ran into something since she really can't get to her eye. I had to take her back and I figured the bigger cone would make it so she couldn't run into anything so I left it on this time. I was wrong and her top stitch has come undone. I'm very frustrated and unsure of what else to do once we get them redone. 

She can't see very well anyway as she's losing sight as she's getting older. This is happening after I go to bed too as I treat them at night and then check them in the morning. 

Some advice would be greatly appreciated because, while she seems thankfully unbothered by this, it costs us a decent chunk of change every time we have to get her stitches redone and restarts the healing time all over again",0,1598616356

This is why some foods are safe for humans, but can be toxic and potentially deadly to dogs.

On the other hand, there are many perfectly safe and even healthy human foods that dogs can eat as an occasional treat.

This article gives an overview of  foods and indicates whether your dog can eat them

# 1. Carrots

Raw and cooked carrots are safe for your dog.

Carrots  are low in calories and a good source of vitamins, minerals and fibre.  They are therefore a very healthy food for your dog.

Before giving your dog carrots, be sure to cut them into bite-sized pieces to prevent him from choking.

# 2. Eggs

Cooked eggs are perfectly safe and nutritious for dogs.

An  average egg provides a portion of almost all vitamins and minerals, as  well as a lot of protein. Some argue that eggs can also help relieve  nausea in dogs, although there is no scientific evidence to support this  claim.

It  is important to note that you should avoid giving raw eggs to your dog.  While dogs generally do not get sick by eating raw eggs, bacteria, such  as salmonella, can be transmitted from the dog to its human owners,  increasing their risk of infection

# 3. Salmon

Cooked and boneless salmon is a safe and healthy food for your dog.

Salmon  is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to  reduce inflammation and can help keep your dog's skin and coat healthy.

However,  you should avoid giving raw salmon to your dog. It may contain a  parasite known to cause salmon poisoning disease, which can be fatal

# 4. Bread

White or wholemeal bread is safe for most dogs, who can eat it as an occasional treat.

Before  giving bread to your dog, make sure it doesn't contain any additional  ingredients, such as raisins, that could be potentially harmful.

Also,  remember that bread, along with other foods, adds extra calories to  your dog's diet and can lead to weight gain if he eats too much.

# 5. Blueberries

Blueberries are safe and nutritious for dogs.

Blueberries  are a rich source of disease-fighting antioxidants and provide a  significant amount of vitamins, minerals and fibre, all of which can be  beneficial to your dog's health.

In addition, blueberries are low in calories and small, making them a great treat for your dog.

# 6. Pineapple

Fresh pineapple can be safely eaten by dogs in small quantities.

In addition, pineapple is rich in vitamins, minerals and fibre, making it an excellent nutrient-rich snack for your dog.

As  with other foods, dogs may experience symptoms such as nausea and  diarrhea if they eat too much pineapple. So it's best to give your dog a  small amount of pineapple at a time.

Hi - any help would be appreciated! 

I have an old leather tote bag that I use to pack up my 10 month old frenchies stuff when we go to the park. Today I saw he had a small strip of leather in his mouth (about 1 in height c 1cm width).

DogCare,icmtus,tugboatfrontiersman,1,Introducing dogs,"TLDR: I'm seeking guidance on supporting my dog who can be aggressive toward other dogs in integrating with our family from away's animals. 

Hi All, 

I have a 2yo male fixed wheaten who is lovely in all aspects except that he really isn't a fan of other dogs. He had some negative experiences early on that I believe really impacted him and we work on it, but because of COVID had fewer chances in 2020. He's typically fine on leashed walks with other dogs and also leashed, in neutral locations, as long as they aren't overly rough with him. He was great with all dogs until about 1yo in off-leash environments and then something switched; he can just be unpredictable, but we're learning and working through his triggers. We have had similarly mixed experiences with other dogs if they come to our homes as well. 

 My best friend also has a 2yo fixed male hound mix and lives about 3 hours away. His dog is not dog-aggressive but also is a bit wild mannered, in a cute way, but not necessarily good for easy introductions. The two dogs have never interacted other than one weekend, which was tough because my dog was entering into an established 'pack' of local dogs that all roughhouse together. We ended up keeping him separate for most of that experience. 

Because of the distance, typically we've had coverage for other families to care for one or the other during visits.  We are visiting him this weekend and he is coming to us in a few weeks from now for a visit. While we can both likely find dog coverage these weekends, and this only happens a few times a year, I'd love to find a way to safely have both dogs in the same house as we all get older and planning get-togethers can be more complicated. It would be very hard to meet in between for neutral meetups beforehand. 

I am not saying that I'm going to do this right away on these particular visits, but what are things I can do beforehand to help my dog? What are some immediate introductory activities that might help them acclimate in addition to a long leashed walk together? I don't think they need to be off-leash together right away (or at all even), but what are some strategies to help dogs when they're both inside the house and we're cooking meals, etc? I just want to make sure that if and when we do this, I'm ready for a super positive experience for both dogs, to reduce their stress and still have a great visit with friends.",0,1597840696

So my dog had her anal glands manually expressed at the vet a little over a month ago and the vet said they were pretty full (she was having loose stools for a while due to worms we were treating). Before we took her to the vet she was randomly expressing on the couch (only there) and that happened quite a bit. After the vet, she manually expressed once a week later (thought maybe it was a muscle contraction after having the manual expression done). And then she expressed a tiny tiny bit once last night and once today. On the couch again. Her stools lately have been firm at the beginning then looser when the stool finishes. 

So we first tried a warm compress on the area for 10 mins and nothing leaked out. Then tried manually expressing a couple hours later and nothing came out. It‚Äôs weird that she randomly expressed yesterday and today (literally only a dot but everyone can smell that) yet the glands aren‚Äôt full?

My dog, Buster, (a generally anxious border collie mix) lately has been isolating himself randomly each day. He doesn't self-isolate ALL day, but he does it here and there for some periods of time. We adopted him from a shelter as a puppy (he is 6), and he is not necessarily the most ""normal"" dog, but this behavior is not typical for him. He is otherwise healthy - eating normally, going for his usual walks, same energy level, etc.  
  
We have had some recent changes in the house. My oldest son is away for a month, so he may have some anxiety over this (they're pals) but in addition, my father's husband, who lives with us, was recently diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing chemo. I think Buster sense this because, well, maybe he sees the stress in the house, or even possibly smells the cancer (we had a weird situation where Buster became extremely frightened when meeting a friend for the first time, and it turned out not long after that this friend was diagnosed with lymphoma on a good portion of his torso).  
  
In any case, I don't think my dog is seriously injured or sick. I am almost positive that, whatever the reason, he is feeling anxious or stressed out about what's happening in the house.  
  
Hopefully someone can help me understand what's going on with him, and how to make him feel better. We try to console him, and show him lots of affection, but he still runs off to random parts of the house to be alone. :(

DogCare,i6xk89,devereaux98,1,"Dachshund has elephant skin under her armpits, vets are giving bad advice","Our dachshund, about 2 years old, has really rough and chafed skin underneath her armpits.  It's worth noting we live in a rather dry climate as well.  We've tried giving her lotion/ointment as well.  When taking her to the vet they usually just tell us to give her a bath and then charge us a huge fee.   
 Recently they recommended that she take the prescription medicine ""Apoquel"", but when reading up on it, the internet has shown us that it could give dogs cancer.

We're not quite sure what to do at this point, all my internet research just says ""get her to a vet"" but as you can see it's not really possible, and we really can't afford to be taking her multiple times to different places.  We are willing to shell out a reasonable amount of money for a definitive answer.  Please help my little puppy, she LOVES to exercise and go on walks/hikes, and it breaks my heart to see her in such discomfort!  Thank you.",14,1597030982

DogCare,i69x2o,Fidiali,1,Ideas for the most suitable dog breed?,"My husband and I have stated the process of trying to get approval from out landlord for a dog and I wanted to see if you guys have any recommendations for a suitable dog breed. 

We live in a 2br apartment. It's on the ground floor but the only access to outside is a standard size balcony which we would not be able to keep open when it's cold/when we are not home. 

I know the smaller the dog the more suitable but I love large dogs and really want a dog that I can take on long walks and to the beach. I'm also worried about the dog barking, especially if we leave it at home alone. We are both working at home atm, and I would likely take the dog with me to work at least a few days a week once we go back. We don't have kids but will start trying in a year or so. 

I am possibly thinking a miniature groodle. My husband really likes cavalier king Charles but I am not 100 % convinced. Do you have any pros/cons against these breeds, or possibly some other suggestions?

We have discussed getting a rescue dog as well, but at this point in our lives we don't know if we can give it the additional attention that it may need. So far we have decided we will look more into it for our second dog.",0,1596932321

So I have a 6 year old mix of rough collie and she peed a little and I noticed blood drops in her urine. This is the first time something like this happened. She's pretty healthy overall. Checked her fur, she has little blood on it too, and I am not sure what can I do right now cause when I google, I get the most scary things possible and I have to wait until tomorrow because even though vet is my first option, I have nowhere where I can take her.

DogCare,i5m4vs,kifcho,1,My dog doen't recognize me and is aggressive towards me,"Hello guys, I'm finding myself in a strange situation and am lost. You've seen the title but here is my story.

My parents and I have a 1.2 years old GS named Axel. He is wonderful big boy and we all love him to death. A week ago my folks went away and took the dog with them(I should make note this is not the first time the dog and I have been separated for more than few days). Well today they got home, I wasn't there when they arrived but got home maybe 10 mins after them. As I entered the house, Axel was waiting on the door and he welcomed me into the house, he seemed very happy to see me and was egar to play. I went to say hello to my parents and as I was doing that I turned to Axel because I wanted to pet him, he growled so I decided he needed space and I gave it to him. A couple minutes after that , while I was catching up with my parents he came directly to me and stood next to me , again being visibly okay and happy. I took that as a sign he was okay with me and reached to pet him very gently, as soon as i touched him he lauched at me, aiming for the neck. I wasn't bitten and he was restrained. Nobody got hurt. Instantly everyone was on edge and very nervous. He got taken outside to the backyard while we could all calm down.After a few minutes I got close to the door of the backyard so he could see me and I called him on his name and tried to talk to him but he began barking at me so I moved away from his view. After that my parents went outside with him to calm him down and see how he was doing. We decided after he calm down they would put muzzle on him and we would meet again in a bit more controlled way. My folks told me after they got home he instantly went towards my room to look for me so we decided it might be a good idea for me to stay in my room and he would come , and find me in my normal space. He was very hesitant and didn't want to cross into my room at first but came in after a litte bit of food motivation. I was directly across him with a lot of space between us and it was all good. He was very calm and layed on the floor with his head on the flood. After seeing how relaxed he was I moved towards him ever so slightly. Nothing changed. Moved again, no changes. Repeat a few times. After I am quite close to him, I gave him a litte bit of food and he was very eagar to take it and showed no hesitation or anything else. Next I stared reaching a little bit with my arm so he can have a good smell, he went to smell it and in the instant he smelled my hand he started snarling and showing aggression again. After that he was again, taken outside. A few things to be added: 1) For the last year we've had him I have walked him every day 2)I give him some of his meals 3)We play together a lot 4)He has never been like that ever to me, although he bit my dad once after a bit of a fiasco but showed remorse instantly and never did anything again. 5)They way he looks at me is like he has never met me and doesn't know who I am, but I think he is concious that I exist (going for my room as soon as he came home)

We played, he was active and he ate as usual. He could still jump up on the bed and the couch and he still had clear eyes.  By Saturday morning he was lethargic and did not want to eat.  He did still drink water. He would labor breathe every once in a while. We took him to the vet that day and he got xrays and an exam.  The vet did not see anything too abnormal for an elderly dog so she wanted to refer us to a cardiologist. We were still worried so this past Monday we took him back and they kept him for observation for the day, took more xrays and did blood work.  Everything came back negative, no heartworm, no enlarged heart, no cancer, valley fever, diabetes or anything.  We were going to try and get him a CT scan to see if he had a mass behind his heart but 2 days ago Wednesday morning I walked into the room where he was laying on his belly and he was basically stretched all the way backwards with his his head upside down.  I flopped him back over, his lip twitched a couple of times and he was gone.

Now I know he was old and died of old age but I need to know exactly how.  The way he died, is that the signs of a heart attack? Stroke? Aneurysm? When we took him back to get cremated they told us they didnt do autopsies. I'm obviously still grieving and I just need to know and to me it just happened so suddenly.

So I recently adopted a dog and, as I'm sure a lot of first time dog owners are, I'm worried about whether I'm providing enough or too much exercise for my boy. Shelter said he is a Catahoula mix, so I know he has a big exercise requirement, but he is also almost 7 years old so I don't want to be overly taxing on him due to me overcompensating.

He always seems ready to go on walks, and I've been doing 4 walks a day, each averaging about 25-30ish minutes (with a few minutes of those being jogging until I get tired...), and he always comes inside and seems to be really tired, but within an hour or two seems ready to go again.

If I was overexercising him, is it safe to assume his excitement for going outside would diminish?

For the time being (it's only been 3 days of having him) is this an appropriate amount of activity until he trusts me enough to do mental training, and eventually more ""freeing"" types of activity where he can open up in to full sprints, etc?

I guess my question really boils down to, What are some of the signs I should look for to know that I'm providing enough but not too much exercise in the early stages of ownership while trust is still being built.",23,1595784117

DogCare,ht137q,simoraad,1,A list of human foods that dogs can eat," 

Dogs and humans metabolize food differently.

This is why some foods are safe for humans, but can be toxic and potentially deadly to dogs.

On the other hand, there are many perfectly safe and even healthy human foods that dogs can eat as an occasional treat.

This article gives an overview of  foods and indicates whether your dog can eat them

**1. Peanut Butter**

Peanut butter is a safe and healthy treat that dogs can consume in moderate amounts.

However,    it is best to limit your dog's consumption of peanut butter. Because    peanut butter is high in fat and calories, it can lead to weight gain  if   it eats too much .

Don't   forget  to give your dog unsalted peanut butter. Peanut butter is often    enriched with additional ingredients, such as salt, which can be  harmful   to your dog

**2. Eggs**

Cooked eggs are perfectly safe and nutritious for dogs.

An    average egg provides a portion of almost all vitamins and minerals,  as   well as a lot of protein. Some argue that eggs can also help  relieve   nausea in dogs, although there is no scientific evidence to  support this   claim.

It  is  important to note  that you should avoid giving raw eggs to your dog.   While dogs generally  do not get sick by eating raw eggs, bacteria, such   as salmonella, can  be transmitted from the dog to its human owners,   increasing their risk  of infection

**3. Salmon**

Cooked and boneless salmon is a safe and healthy food for your dog.

Salmon    is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to    reduce inflammation and can help keep your dog's skin and coat healthy.

However,    you should avoid giving raw salmon to your dog. It may contain a    parasite known to cause salmon poisoning disease, which can be fatal

**4. Carrots**

Raw and cooked carrots are safe for your dog.

Carrots    are low in calories and a good source of vitamins, minerals and  fibre.   They are therefore a very healthy food for your dog.

Before giving your dog carrots, be sure to cut them into bite-sized pieces to prevent him from choking.

**5. Blueberries**

Blueberries are safe and nutritious for dogs.

Blueberries    are a rich source of disease-fighting antioxidants and provide a    significant amount of vitamins, minerals and fibre, all of which can be    beneficial to your dog's health.

In addition, blueberries are low in calories and small, making them a great treat for your dog.

**6. Pineapple**

Fresh pineapple can be safely eaten by dogs in small quantities.

In addition, pineapple is rich in vitamins, minerals and fibre, making it an excellent nutrient-rich snack for your dog.

As    with other foods, dogs may experience symptoms such as nausea and    diarrhea if they eat too much pineapple. So it's best to give your dog a    small amount of pineapple at a time.

**7. Bread**

White or wholemeal bread is safe for most dogs, who can eat it as an occasional treat.

Before    giving bread to your dog, make sure it doesn't contain any additional    ingredients, such as raisins, that could be potentially harmful.

Also,    remember that bread, along with other foods, adds extra calories to    your dog's diet and can lead to weight gain if he eats too much.

DogCare,hse6zv,Chubbs858,1,My dog is Chef Gordon Ramsay about food.,"Bellamy the Shih Maltipoo (aka Gordon Ramsay) will starve himself for days when he's over a food. 

The adoption agency lady LOVES animals and would home make all their food. So this guy went from mother's milk to crock pot chicken and veggies (for at least a month - we got him at 3 months old).

Not only does he have a pallet for quality food, but he also gets tired of the same flavors. He will reject a food if he has the same flavor too many times in a row. If I freeze it and bring it back a month later, he won't even touch it even if he loved it before.

Around 6 months, vet told me to just leave food and he will eat it eventually. He will literally not eat for 3 days in a row until he starts throwing up stomach acid. 

This is the kicker - he literally tosses the plate! (With his nose). He will throw his food into his water dish, bury it with towels, put it in his mouth and spit it on the floor. Tbh, it's hilarious! He's a smart lil doggie, so I know he's just throwing a divo fit so I'll give in. He's a really good boy other than that. Everyone adores him and compliments his good boyness. He just puts his Chef Ramsay hat on when I put a bowl down in front of him that he's displeased about. 

I know he's trained my ass to serve him good stuff, but I get worried when he doesn't eat for days. Also stomach acid barfs aren't great for carpet. üòÖ

DogCare,hsbpue,rkmodi500,1,Signs of Flea and Worms in dogs,"  

The most common parasites you may find in your dog are Fleas and Worms. This article will outline the signs of each and how to prevent them from entering your dog and your home.  
 

Fleas ‚Äì they live on animals and feed on their blood. They are most commonly seen in clusters in warm areas and areas the dog finds it hard to reach e.g. behind the ears, armpits, base of the tail. If you spot black dirt on your dog, put a bit on white paper, and put a drop of water on it, if it turns bloody brown, your furry friend has fleas!!  
 

Dogs should be treated for fleas every 2 months. Prevention is better than cure! If they‚Äôre on your dog, they‚Äôre in your house!!  
 

Signs of fleas:  
 

* Fleas/flea dirt visible
*  Scratching/licking a lot
*  Flea bite allergy causing the skin to become inflamed
*  Hair loss
*  Anxiety/stress
*  Dog quickly looking/biting at the base of the tail
*  Anemia

when you spot an infestation, you should get the [best flea medicine for dogs](https://bestdoggear.com/best-flea-medicine-for-dogs/) right away. This way, your pooch won‚Äôt suffer from the skin problem and you won‚Äôt have to deal with massive cleanup at home

  
 Worms ‚Äì they live inside the dog and can be seen in the feces when the dog goes to the toilet.  
 

Dogs should be wormed every 2wks until they are 12wks old, then every month until they are 6 months old and then every 3 months for the rest of their life.  
 

Signs of worms:  
 

* Coat dull and in poor condition
*  Always hungry but losing weight
*  Looks bloated
*  Vomiting
*  Diarrhea
*  Constipation
*  Anal irritation
*  Burping
*  Coughing

 You should always be on the lookout for signs of Fleas and Worms. One of the people who might notice this better than others could be your dog groomer.",0,1594913587

Our shibachi was definitely the boss of the house; she would clean our chiweenie's face daily, and our chiweenie would follow her everywhere she went. 

Our shibachi passed away at the vet on June 10, after a months long battle with pulmonary heart failure. She was there for a check-up and while we knew she probably didn't have much time left, we were not expecting it to happen during the visit. We brought the chiweenie to the vet so she could sniff/see our shibachi and understand what happened. 

Ever since then, our chiweenie has acted very differently. She sleeps more often, she wants to know where my husband and I are at at all times and grows anxious if she can't find one of us. She has always been food obsessed, and while her appetite is still good, she doesn't like to eat now unless she knows where we're both at. Sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night and seems to wander as if lost or looking for something. 

When our friend's dog comes over, her old self shines through again. She becomes more confident, and trails the other dog through the house like she used to with our shibachi. It's almost seems like she needs another dog to act like the leader and make her feel more safe and secure.

**So, the diet would look something like this-**

Breakfast: 250g chicken neck/ chicken frame/ chicken wing¬†

Dinner: 1.5 cup kibble + 250g mince beef.

I'm unsure of whether it'll be okay to mix wet meat with kibble from some sources though.

**My friend recommended me the PMR raw diet and has calculated this for me-**

Split between two meals:¬†

1050g red meat (beef, roo)¬†  
130g raw bone (chicken neck, chicken feet- keep the nails, duck neck, wings)¬†  
66g (cow liver)  
66g (giblets, kidney, spleen or lungs)¬†

**Alternatively, could I just feed my greyhound solely kibbles?**

Ever since then he seems scared of me and me only. He likes the rest of my family and even gets excited when he sees my 2 sisters who got married and don2even see him that often.

Whenever I get close to him he just stops in place and acts like he doesn't see me, until I  move, then he jumps back

The reason he bit me was because i tried scratching his neck and I'm guessing that scared him. The only time he seems happy to see me is when I bring him food or water

Recently he‚Äôs engaged in two behaviors that have made me concerned. The first time I found him trying to eat our mini blind string. Half of the string was down his throat. I pulled it entirely out. After this, he was pacing a ton and acting like he might vomit, while trying to eat everything in sight. After a half hour or so, he stopped swallowing excessively and things were normal. (This was about two months ago) 

Then today, I catch him doing the same exact thing but with the physical curtains. He is swallowing excessively so I run him outside in case he vomits and the entire time he‚Äôs trying to eat every thing on the ground. It‚Äôs been about 20 minutes and he seems fine now. 

He was at the vet last week for his annual. No issues. Nothing in diet has changed. Stool is relatively normal. Nothing foreign. He doesn‚Äôt chew things up out of bad behavior and hasn‚Äôt for years. 

Is he making himself sick for attention? My husband and I work a lot and today I had spent 5+ hours on homework while he was longing to be outside. I‚Äôm really not sure if it‚Äôs that or anxiety. Of course, I‚Äôm trying to avoid another $300 vet visit. Can anyone give me some advice? Is this normal?",9,1592954824

He's the dog I always wanted, and he's my little man. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 7 months now and we live an hour apart. Since we both have weekends off, we alternate who stays where. One weekend, I stay at her place, one weekend she stays at mine. My friend has been popping in 3 times a day (morning, mid day, evening) to let Jace out and make sure he has food and water when it's my weekend to be gone. Unfortunately, my friend will be moving soon and won't be able to continue doing this. I don't have any family, and all of my other friends who would be ok with doing this have already left the area as well. I can't take Jace with me since my girlfriend's landlord does not allow dogs. I also don't live near any dog boarders. I was wondering if I could get him an automatic feeder and automatic water bowl along with one of those fake grass dog pads and leave him with that for 2 days. He doesn't have separation anxiety, and has gotten used to me being gone a whole weekend. I'm just wondering if this is a feasible option (I know it most likely is not, but I figured it never hurts to ask). Any and all advice and constructive criticism is welcome.",3,1592609502
DogCare,hcaf5q,SugaFairy,1,Is this a tick on my dogs head?,"Hello all-

Please don‚Äôt laugh but I‚Äôve never seen a tick in person before. I googled images and apparently ticks can also be light tan in color; I always thought they were black. We live in the high desert in California if that helps. 

I have a 15 year old female golden retriever. Born with heart disease but in surprisingly good health despite how old she is. She still wants to play fetch. Bad skin allergies but controlled with homemade diet and diatomaceous earth. 

The bump is about the size of half a pea.. maybe a touch bigger; and it could have only been there a few days because the area on her head is where she gets lots of pats and scratches. It doesn‚Äôt feel hard but it‚Äôs not soft either; almost like a wart or a pimple feel to it. 

I don‚Äôt see any tick legs and when I tried to do the usual tick removal protocols (tweezer, dish soap, oil etc) it didn‚Äôt loosen. It doesn‚Äôt seem to itch her or cause any discomfort unless you mess with it. When I took a tweezer to it lightly to see if I could see any legs my pup didn‚Äôt care for that. I was afraid to squeeze it for obvious reasons. 

A vet trip is not possible right now due to my own illness. Hoping for some guidance if anyone knows if this is indeed a tick or has seen something similar. Images below. Thank you in advance for any input.

DogCare,had3vk,simoraad,1,A list of human foods that dogs can eat,"Dogs and humans metabolize food differently.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why some foods are safe for humans, but can be toxic and potentially deadly to dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, there are many perfectly safe and even healthy human foods that dogs can eat as an occasional treat.

This article gives an overview of  foods and indicates whether your dog can eat them 

# 1. Peanut Butter

Peanut butter is a safe and healthy treat that dogs can consume in moderate amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is best to limit your dog's consumption of peanut butter. Because peanut butter is high in fat and calories, it can lead to weight gain if it eats too much .

&amp;#x200B;

Don't forget to give your dog unsalted peanut butter. Peanut butter is often enriched with additional ingredients, such as salt, which can be harmful to your dog

# 2. Eggs

Cooked eggs are perfectly safe and nutritious for dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

An average egg provides a portion of almost all vitamins and minerals, as well as a lot of protein. Some argue that eggs can also help relieve nausea in dogs, although there is no scientific evidence to support this claim.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to note that you should avoid giving raw eggs to your dog. While dogs generally do not get sick by eating raw eggs, bacteria, such as salmonella, can be transmitted from the dog to its human owners, increasing their risk of infection

# 3. Salmon

Cooked and boneless salmon is a safe and healthy food for your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to reduce inflammation and can help keep your dog's skin and coat healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

However, you should avoid giving raw salmon to your dog. It may contain a parasite known to cause salmon poisoning disease, which can be fatal

# 4. Carrots

Raw and cooked carrots are safe for your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Carrots are low in calories and a good source of vitamins, minerals and fibre. They are therefore a very healthy food for your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Before giving your dog carrots, be sure to cut them into bite-sized pieces to prevent him from choking.

# 5. Blueberries

Blueberries are safe and nutritious for dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

Blueberries are a rich source of disease-fighting antioxidants and provide a significant amount of vitamins, minerals and fibre, all of which can be beneficial to your dog's health.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, blueberries are low in calories and small, making them a great treat for your dog.

# 6. Pineapple

Fresh pineapple can be safely eaten by dogs in small quantities.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, pineapple is rich in vitamins, minerals and fibre, making it an excellent nutrient-rich snack for your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

As with other foods, dogs may experience symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea if they eat too much pineapple. So it's best to give your dog a small amount of pineapple at a time.

# 7. Bread

White or wholemeal bread is safe for most dogs, who can eat it as an occasional treat.

&amp;#x200B;

Before giving bread to your dog, make sure it doesn't contain any additional ingredients, such as raisins, that could be potentially harmful.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, remember that bread, along with other foods, adds extra calories to your dog's diet and can lead to weight gain if he eats too much.

I have a 10-11 ish year old morkie. little dog. she was completly heathly and never had a problem until a year ago. she was having kidney problems and our vet of 25+ years STRONGLY suggested a surgery. he is very open about not being a ""miracle doctor"" and doesnt do anything he doesnt believe is worth it. so we did it, and after she was back to normal in no time and 100% healthy. now fast foward, a little over a week ago we realized she wasnt eating, puking, and was acting funny so we brought her to the vet. he says her kidneys are failing and ran her blood and her levels were at a 9.8. he did some treatments and they only went down to a 7.2 and said she would no longer eat and it was time to do what we had to do. we asked if we could take her home and have her put to sleep at home with the people she loves in a comfortable enviroment and he said yes because she wasnt suffering. he told us if she doesnt eat in 48 hrs we had to do it if she does eat to call because he could try meds if shes eating. we get her home and she perks up and is alert as could be tail wagging trotting around and ATE a full meal!!!!! we call, no response for 2 days now. this is where it gets tricky...around midnight last night She has what we considered to be a seizure. it was so scary. I still have not slept and I watched her all night. it lasted about 2 minutes and when it was done she popped right back to normal. at 5am she had another- when she was done she walked herself to the kitchen ate, drank, went outside and went to the bathroom. due to the seizures I thought I knew what I had to do. before the seizures I made an appointment with a vet who does holistic and normal care for a second opinion because something just seemed fishy and everyone I spoke to said that if her levels were really that high it would be impossible that she was eating, alert and happy. I called in the morning and explain what happened and he said to bring her in- he suggest the seizures are nothing to worry about and it could be from all the medication she was on and he physically would not put the dog down just for seizures. he called the other vet and they REFUSED to send her bloodwork results over. i dont know whats really going on with my dog. this new vet  feels very strongly about a treatment and suggests we hold out until monday to see. now tonight like the night before around 10pm she had another. I obviously want my dog to live and have the best possible chance at survival but I'm also not the type of pet owner to want to hold on to false hope for my own sake and let her suffer. I don't know what to do. it breaks my heart watching her go through the sezuires and i dont want to continue to try treatments if it's the wrong thing. has anyone had a similiar experience? or what they would do if it was their dog? its easier the make the decision when you can tell its whats best but shes happy. she eats. she acts like she wants to live. im so torn.",10,1592109541

Now that it's 100% dry food he won't eat much anymore. I'll mix some treats and he'll eat that with some kiddle but would not finish the bowl anymore. Any suggestions as to what I should do? I'm giving him science hills chicken n barley (I believe). He's a 10 month old lab mix that I rescued from a shelter 4 months ago. Hasn't had an issue eating til now.",4,1591657416

My dogs poop has gone from brown(form, normal consistency) in the mornings to yellowish or light brown(soft, mushy, hard to pick up) in the evenings. Is there a reason for this? I feed her the same thing for breakfast and dinner. And the treats I occasionally give her are peanut butter or veggies. And sometimes bananas. I‚Äôve taken her to different vets over this multiple times already. They usually take a stool sample to look for parasites. They gave me Mricroflora packets to add to her food and that seemed to help a lot. Should she be on this for the rest of her life? This problem was more frequent when I fed her Nutro Essentials Brown Rice &amp; Sweet Potatoes kibble for small breeds. It seemed to stop and she had regular brown stools when I switched her kibble to Merrick Healthy Grains. I feed her 1/4 cup for breakfast and the same for dinner. After walks or playtime I give her a few kibbles as a treat. She‚Äôs a 6lb chihuahua, 5 years old. What can I do? I‚Äôve already tried giving her pumpkin &amp; a bland diet.",10,1591478941

The short version is that I think she because has been with us almost constantly during the quarantine that it's caused her to have anxiety when she can't be with us.

The past several nights she has been whining and panting when we put her to bed in her crate. She previously had no problem with it. She does eventually calm down in about 30 minutes or less though.

Some other details: The past few weeks she has had a reduced appetite but always accepts treats. She doesn't seem to be losing weight so it might just be her metabolism slowing down. She also has been playing outside a lot less. She may be a little bored which I'm trying to remedy.

In January, Lilly, our 15F beagle/jack-russel mix passed away. Daisy used to sleep with her. We kept everything the same and she had no problem sleeping alone until just recently. We do plan to adopt another pack member soon though, so maybe that will help.

Just now, Daisy calmed down in 15 minutes after being put to bed. Maybe things are getting better.

Then I grabbed some of his food from the package and put hit on my hand. This time he looked at me with his ears back and instead of grabbing the food, he bitted me.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bad for him because my older sister got our dog when I was only 11 years old and she was responsible for him but barely trained him. I feel like an asshole because he is 6 years and not trained. I was very young to know how to train our dog and it was not even my responsibility. I don't even know if that's a valid excuse. I feel like im the only one that cares about him but I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, his vet told us that he was aggressive by nature or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do, I feel bad for my dog and I just want to be with him but now he doesn't trust me at all, even when I try to pet him I'm scared that he will bit me. I want him to be happy but it feels like he only respects my mom and is scared of everyone else.",0,1590670133
DogCare,grz7bg,nachoslut,1,Could change in diet make dog poop smaller?,"We recently started switching our dog from Solid Gold grain free food (which he has been eating his whole life/~5 yrs) to Royal Canin Shih Tzu kibble (which is not grain free). We have been switching him gradually over the course of 2 weeks. 

His stool has gotten a lot smaller since we switched him. He eats about 75% Royal Canin &amp; 25% Solid Gold now. His stool is mostly firm and he will eliminate about 2 logs that are about 3-4 inches long &amp; not too skinny, but he used to poop about twice as much when he was only eating Solid Gold. Since switching food, he also has sometimes made a harder stool followed by a softer stool that isn‚Äôt as easy to pick up but it hasn‚Äôt been a regular occurrence. 

He is acting pretty normal otherwise. He doesn‚Äôt seem to like the Royal Canin as much as his old food so we do have to coax him in to eating the new food but he does eventually eat most of his daily portion. (To be honest though, he‚Äôs always been a picky eater and we always have to add boiled or raw carrots to his food to get him to eat. But he really hasn‚Äôt taken to Royal Canin).

Is this something to worry about? Does he need a vet visit? 

[We switched foods because my family Frenchie just passed away from a heart condition his cardiologist attributed to a grain free diet so I decided to switch my dog to a grain inclusive diet. We only fed him Solid Gold grain free because that‚Äôs what the rescue he was born in feeds all their dogs so we never switched it. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be allergic to Royal Canin (no licking paws, no tearing eyes, no itching any more than usual).]

Just wondering if smaller stools require a visit to the vet or if it‚Äôs most likely just because of his new food. I would have thought a grain inclusive food would make more stool but maybe not?",6,1590639116

DogCare,go1cfe,simoraad,2,top of the Healthiest Foods You Can Give to Your Dog," Dogs  are famous for begging while you‚Äôre eating at the table or snacking in  the kitchen. But in this case, beggars can be choosers. That‚Äôs because  there are numerous foods you should never give to your dog. Fortunately,  for every food scrap you shouldn‚Äôt let Sparky vacuum up from under the  table, there‚Äôs another food scrap that‚Äôs OK, or even great, for your  dog‚Äôs diet. We don‚Äôt recommend feeding your dog right from the table, of  course. (Unless you want him there, like clockwork, begging every time  you sit down for a meal or snack.) But if you do want to share some food  with your pet, it‚Äôs important to know which foods are the best to give  your dog.

Many  of the foods people eat are safe for dogs. And some are even healthy  additions to your dog‚Äôs diet. Feed Fido the right foods, and he‚Äôll get  health benefits, such as better immunity, stronger joints, and even  fresher breath. Sounds like a win-win. As Lindsay-Jean Hard reports for  Food52, there are some general guidelines that can help you figure out  what you should and shouldn‚Äôt feed your dog. For instance, be careful  with foods that are high in sugar and fat. As Hard explains, ‚ÄúChances  are if you know you should be eating something in moderation, your pet  should be, too.‚Äù

You  also should avoid spicy foods, which can wreak havoc on a dog‚Äôs  digestive system. And keep in mind that, according to experts, no more  than 5% of your dog‚Äôs diet should come from treats or people food.  Commercially sold dog foods are designed to provide your canine with a  healthy, balanced diet. Curious about which people foods you can share  with your canine? Read on to check out some of the best foods to give  your dog.

**1. Shrimp and fish**

The  American Kennel Club reports that fully cooked shrimp with a shell  removed can be a good food for your dog's diet. Fish is another seafood  that is good for your dog, thanks to all the good fats and amino acids.  The AKC specifically recommends salmon and sardines. Salmon is rich in  vitamins and protein, and sardines have soft, digestible bones that give  your dog a calcium supplement.

For  all fish other than sardines, be sure to remove all small bones. Do not  give your dog raw or undercooked fish, and make sure he does not eat  fish more than twice a week. And if you give your dog tuna, make sure it  is prepared only in water and not in oil, and that it does not contain  spices.

**2. Chicken and turkey**

If  your dog's diet needs extra protein, cooked and unskilled chicken is  one of the best additions. Chicken prepared without spices or seasoning  is also a great option if you suddenly run out of dog food and don't  have time to go to the store.

Turkey  is another food to share with your dog, as long as it is not covered  with seasonings, such as garlic, which can be very toxic to your dog.  Before putting the leftover turkey back on, remove excess fat and skin.  Also check for bones. Poultry bones can break into your dog's digestive  system and cause a blockage or tear in the intestines.

**3. Pork**

Pork  is a highly digestible protein and is full of amino acids. In addition,  pork is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in some pets than  other meats. It should also be noted that pork contains more calories  per pound than other meats, which means that it should be added in  moderation to your dog's diet.

**4. Eggs**

Another  protein option the AKC recommends feeding your dog? Eggs. Eggs are safe  for a dog‚Äôs diet as long as they‚Äôre fully cooked. They‚Äôre a great  source of protein. And they can even help calm an upset stomach. Just be  sure the eggs are cooked all the way through because eating raw egg  whites can give your dog a biotin deficiency.

**5. Oatmeal**

The  Mother Nature Network also recommends oatmeal as a good snack for dogs.  It is an excellent source of fibre, making it ideal for dogs with  intestinal irregularities. It is also a safe source of cereal for dogs  allergic to wheat.

The  Mother Nature Network advises cooking oatmeal well before serving to  your dog. And don't add sugar. Modern Dog points out that oatmeal can be  given in conjunction with probiotics to help dogs maintain the  regularity of their intestines.

**6. Peanut butter and peanuts**

Peanut  butter is an excellent source of protein for dogs. It contains  heart-healthy fats, vitamin B, vitamin E and niacin. The AKC recommends  raw and unsalted peanut butter as the healthiest option for your dog.  This is because it does not contain xylitol, which is a toxic sugar  substitute for dogs.

Peanuts  are also safe for dogs. Be sure to consume them in moderation, as you  do not want your dog to absorb too much fat. Avoid sharing salted  peanuts.

**7. Cashews**

Cashew  nuts are full of useful nutrients, including calcium, magnesium,  antioxidants and protein. They contain less fat than other nuts, such as  nuts, almonds or pecans. But giving too much to your dog can lead to  weight gain and other fat-related problems. So let your dog nibble in  moderation with unsalted cashews only.

**8. Honey**

Honey  is another great food to give to your dog. It is packed with beneficial  nutrients including vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin  K, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and even antioxidants. The AKC  explains that giving your dog a tablespoon of local honey twice a day  can help fight allergies. How? It introduces small amounts of pollen and  helps strengthen your dog's immunity to allergens.

We just got the official diagnosis today that she has an extremely severe case of IBD. Right now she's so uncomfortable and weak all she can do is lay on a pillow. She walks with some difficulty to drink water occasionally,  but otherwise I carry her wherever she needs to go.

There have been a few times in the past few weeks where we really thought she wasn't going to make it. There's still a chance she may not recover, so we're trying to spoil her as much as we can. With her IBD she can't eat any special foods, so all her favorite snacks are out, except ice which she's lost interest in for now. 

Lucy is a small shnauzer-yorkie mix. She's great at fetch and she loves bubbles, neither of which she can really enjoy right now. So far, I've ordered her some doggy shirts because she's lost a lot of fur so I want to protect her skin from the sun, and keep her warm in the house.

When she first got her she was eager to go out but as soon as she left the garden she would start to slow down and sometimes turn and try to walk back or would scratch at your leg asking to be picked up.

DogCare,gl38lz,simoraad,0,Foods You Should Never Feed Your Dog," **Your   dog can beg you to eat a piece of what you have for  dinner. Maybe you   give him leftovers because you don‚Äôt want them to be  wasted. You may   think you‚Äôre giving him a treat, but the truth is that  some of the   foods we eat are dangerous to your dog‚Äôs health. We spend  money on our   pets to make sure they are properly vaccinated, that they  are  regularly  examined at the vet and that they eat the best pet food   formulas  available, but we can harm them by giving them food off our   plates.  Dogs have a unique digestive system and certain elements can   make them  sick or cause injury.**

**Here are 15 foods you should never give your dog.**

# 1. Broccoli

Broccoli   is healthy for humans, but it can be deadly for your dog if he  eats a   lot. This vegetable contains a compound called isothiocyanate.   Although  it does not affect people, it can be harmful to your dog.  Don‚Äôt  panic  if your dog steals a mouthful of broccoli, as a small  amount is  not  likely to do any damage, but if you find that a  considerable amount  has  been ingested, you should call your  veterinarian immediately.

# 2. Avocado

Avocados   are dangerous for your dog, even in small quantities. They  contain a   compound called persin which is very toxic to animals. It  causes   diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to dehydration, organ damage  and,   in severe cases, death. If your pet ingests avocados, call your    veterinarian immediately to find out how to treat them.

DogCare,gjztmp,annoying-d0g,1,Need help making my dad care for my dog‚Äôs health,"TLDR at the bottom. My dad is truly the most stubborn person I‚Äôve met. Some backstory, my dog is a 4yr old westie, he is not trained and has never been, and ever since we got him, people in my house have had the bad habit of giving him human food when we eat (besides his own). Now I am back from college because of covid, and I noticed my dog looks a little bit overweight, mind you this dog does not get any physical activity besides sometimes running around the house, no one walks him. When the vet picked him up for his routine checkup and some shot, I asked for her to weight him. He is 4 pounds overweight, and I told my family we needed to get him back to his ideal weight. They all agreed. We said we‚Äôd walk him and stop feeding him food besides his own. And every so often my dad keeps feeding him stuff, and then claims he doesn‚Äôt, and we get into fights. because how hard can it be to NOT feed your dog your food? I am currently crying out of frustration because I was fighting with him again about it. Also, he is the person my dog loves the most and the one who feeds him human food, no one else really does it. I‚Äôm really tired of my dad not understanding our dog‚Äôs health is important, he always laughs it off and says it‚Äôs nothing. But I really worry he won‚Äôt stop being so stubborn until it‚Äôs a life threatening situation, and I‚Äôm tired of fighting and I‚Äôm worried for my dog. I truly don‚Äôt know what else to tell him to make him stop.

Sorry for the long post

She's on a mild diet and she has been pooping regularly so we're not really worried about that either.

If you have anything that's helped for you, even anecdotally, I'll try it.

As w/ any shelter dog, you don't know much about their past, but I was told she was willingly surrendered, along w/ another dog, by her previous owners bc they weren't supposed to have pets and the landlord found out. 

Anyway, she's a year old shepherd/chow mix and she has this strange habit when she goes to eat, of picking up a small amount of her food in her mouth, bringing it to a different area (about 6ft away), dropping it, and then eating it. She does this 2-3 times and then she'll eat from the bowl regularly. 

I just think it's odd, it really bothers my S.O.

But, I have a theory that she may have gotten used to doing this w/ another dog around? Maybe they ate out of the same bowl? She can be pretty submissive so, that's why I have my theory of her picking up this habit due to the other dog.

I‚Äôm currently ‚Äúfostering‚Äù a 4 year old dog (Rocco) for a friend who just finished his military training and has to wait for a promotion before he can be in housing that allows dogs. I‚Äôve had him for just under a year, and I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I‚Äôll have him...a few months at least, a year at most. Rocco is a chonker, and I definitely fed him more than he was used to because he‚Äôs gained weight (we‚Äôre working on that!!), so he‚Äôs a little over 100lbs maybe. 

My other dog (Cleo) is 16, in generally good health but definitely showing signs of aging. She‚Äôs also incredibly passive and has only ever snapped at other dogs when they‚Äôre overly aggressive with her at the park. She‚Äôs about 35lbs.

Rocco has always been extra needy, and really jealous of Cleo if I focus on her more than him, but this worsening behavior I‚Äôm concerned with doesn‚Äôt seem to be directly related to that...maybe I‚Äôm wrong. But most of the time he doesn‚Äôt seem to realize she exists at all, like even as a potential object. He will sit on her, step on her, if she makes the mistake of going in front of him when going down the stairs he‚Äôll come barreling down and she ends up sliding (happened once, was terrified, now I hold her back until he‚Äôs downstairs). If we‚Äôre on a walk, Rocco sees something interesting and Cleo is in between him and the object he‚Äôll try to walk through her instead of around. Yesterday we were rounding the corner of my building and Cleo stopped to pee right next to the building. Rocco sidled right up to her and peed too, and some got on her. Anytime he does these behaviors he doesn‚Äôt look at her or seem to be ‚Äúmad‚Äù...like I said, he‚Äôs acting as if she‚Äôs just physically not present.

Sometimes we‚Äôll be playing fetch inside and Cleo will have the energy to join in. She used to play tug with her sister (who died last year), so she‚Äôll try to do that with Rocco. As soon as she grabs the other end of the toy he‚Äôll drop it and look at me like ‚Äúok now throw the toy because I don‚Äôt have it anymore so you must.‚Äù

DogCare,gbhuu2,Spookybits9737,1,Friends dad is killing their dog with food - advice needed!,"Hi everyone. Turning to Reddit for some advice on this situation, I saw a similar post a few days ago so hopefully all you knowledgeable people might be able to help me and another poster with very similar issues. Tried to format to avoid a wall of text - apologies if this doesn‚Äôt come out right.

Basics - my friend lives with her elderly dad. They own two dogs, a Jackawawa (9M) and a mixed breed Mastiff/staffie (6F).

The issue - He.Will.Not.Stop.Feeding.Them. Like, all the time. For the Jackawawa its not so much of an issue at present, as he‚Äôs pretty active and burns it off (obviously it is an issue in terms of nutrition - but that‚Äôs not my main concern for this post). He seems to equate food with love, and no intervention whether angry/calm/from others will make him see what‚Äôs happening. The Mastiff/staffie has always been on the bigger side, but since lockdown in the UK my friend is a key worker and has been working around 60-90 hours a week to cover sick colleagues so physically cant be home to monitor the amount of food they are being given. He also feeds human food, and the cherry on the proverbial cake and why I‚Äôm writing this post is that last night my friend returned home from work, just in time to see him about to put down a bowl with leftover TIRAMASU in it. For the dogs...

In terms of exercise, because she is working so much he is in charge of daily exercise. she was suspicious of his claims of taking them for a big walk on the local field as her dad has mobility issues himself, so a bit of detective work ensued and it turns out he walks them around the corner to the local green, and sits on the bench, throwing the ball for the Jackawawa. Mastiff/staffie is duly chilling on the grass, nada exercise. All in total, the process takes 15-20 mins.

The aftermath - guys the mastiff/staffie is huge. Ive known them five years now, and since lockdown began, she‚Äôs the biggest she‚Äôs ever been. She can‚Äôt run, waddles around, sleeps all day, and takes a good deal of time to get up onto the couch. For context, I lost my 14 year old bordie last year who was having some mobility issues due to age/wear and tear, and she was far more mobile and agile at 14 than the mastiff/staffie is now, at 6.  When my friend walks her, she‚Äôs incredibly slow, and cannot manage a decent amount of walking at all. Last summer, when me and my friend walked our dogs together, the mastiff/staffie collapsed with exhaustion and it took two of us to get her back up. Seriously worrying.

What we‚Äôve tried - basically every approach possible. Explained that its killing her with kindness, acceptable treat lists, unacceptable food lists, portioning the food to give them daily before my friend goes to work, I‚Äôve tried talking to him, good cop/bad cop approach, you name it we‚Äôve done it. The biggest problem we are encountering is that he is in total denial. He will not accept that there is a problem with her weight. Period. Stock response we usually get is ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt you think she‚Äôs looking slimmer?/don‚Äôt you think she‚Äôs lost weight?/I haven‚Äôt fed them anything since yesterday!!‚Äù. 

For context, my friend is not in denial. She‚Äôs incredibly frustrated, feels incredibly guilty this is happening to her dog and she cant be there to stop it. Its having a real adverse effect on their relationship. Has anyone here been in the same situation? Also probably important to mention, once normal vet visits are allowed she is planning to take the dog to the vets with her dad for a ‚Äúhealth check‚Äù to hopefully shock some sense into him. But obviously we don‚Äôt know when this can happen, so I‚Äôm looking for some advice in the meanwhile!",9,1588338765

DogCare,gad20c,truedillinger,1,Dog Pees and Poops on command but still goes inside,"Hi 

TLDR; Dog has no problem going outside and does it every time but also has no shame going inside even with puppy pads removed and constant cleaning of spots.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background info:  
\-Puppy is 9.5 weeks old name is Buster (Australian Shepard)  
\-I have a second dog Bart (Border Collie/King Shepard) which will turn 11 in a few days (he was made potty training because he never really pooped in the house which is a bit of a miracle as we got him super early at 5.5 weeks due to his mother rejecting the litter).   
\-I have a boyfriend who didn't help raise Bart as a puppy and all he heard was how easy he was to potty train (also doesn't understand how much better Buster is because he is nowhere near as destructive. Bart would eat a shoe in about 11 mins and I don't mean just chew I mean eat whole and would render useless in about 30 seconds.)  
\-we live in a condo and in order to get outside, we need to walk out into a courtyard where the puppy can't really go then back inside to the main building, down two stories to go outside. So getting outside is not quick. 

I think all of this is inpatients but right now Buster goes instantly on command (especially if my boyfriend says the command) even when we go outside but usually only at the beginning of the walk in the same area (first it was just in a rock area but now grass area too). Will occasionally go somewhere else but it would need to be a much longer walk over 30 mins at least. However **sometimes when we go back inside he goes again almost instantly**. He is getting better but progress is slow. There is no warning basically as soon as he gets up we run to take him out as its a pretty consistent pattern there. he can hold it he makes it through the night from about 10:30 to 6:30ish with ""no accidents"" (there is some but its literally while getting dressed as he been up for a bit). **The problem is throughout the day he will just pee and sometimes poo inside where his puppy pads use to be for the most part.** He moves around so silently and he so sneaky about it that often you step in it without knowing.   


Also, I do have two other problems from what I can tell he is scared of night time. Basically his before bed trip involves me having to carry him to his spot and after he goes he runs back inside nearly choking himself on the leash. I actually think he likes indoors better than outdoors (something I am not use to but in comparison I had 500sq ft apartment when I first got Bart and now live in 2 story condo so there is a lot more space). Second, he doesn't seem that treat motivated he likes them but sometimes drops his treats and just moves on (8 different treats thus far). Which actually was similar to Bart but once Bart learned to play fetch the ball was his god and I could make him do anything for a ball plus Bart was really wanted attention all the time and used that to my advantage. Buster well he is far more independent he could go play for hours by himself and not care no one is around him. Which is awesome but it's hard to get his attention.",9,1588179371

During the day she's been amazing (other than the accidents) but nights have been quite hard. She cries quite a bit, maybe for about 15 minutes or more until she passes out. That will be about 3 times a night. We take her to the bathroom, but we don't want to respond to her *every time* because sometimes she doesn't even want to go, she just wants company. I've resorted to ignoring her, but it aches my heart. So how much should be really crying? Am I doing something wrong?

How to mend the bond.,"     And by tussle I mean the Dane got super aggressive and was shoving her head at the havanese after the wound. The wound itself was what appeared to be a small scratch along her tongue due to a bite. According to my mother and sister it looked like she was biting at her. Afterward we speculated that Little dog in the heat of the moment bit her own tongue(I mean how does a Great Dane with such big teeth leave a little mark on a hard to reach spot). My question is can they hang out anymore? 

      My mom is afraid of our Dane now because she thinks next time the Dane might kill the little dog. I mean our Dane probably didn‚Äôt even spill the blood, but she now thinks the dog is going to attack everything, even the neighbors, even though there is no proof of that. Is there some form of self therapy that can get them together? I realize I‚Äôll have to keep an eye out from now on, but they love each other and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any malice.

DogCare,g7ytz6,i_panic_for_a_living,1,12 year old Sheltie about to be Put Down. Please Help!,"My Sheltie is 12 years old  and around 3 weeks ago she started displaying these symptoms:

1. coughing
2. Clearing her throat
3. Throwing up
4. Having issues walking
5. She is falling
6. Will barely eat
7. Sleeps most of the time

The fist vet said she had an enlarged spleen, spinal compression and a cough. They ran an x-ray and saw these issues. They put her on two antibiotics for her cough, but that didn't work. We were't happy with this vet, as they didn't answer most of our questions.

The second vet said he saw spinal and neck compression and issues with her hips. He put her on pain meds and said a surgery would help, but she's too old.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are my concerns:**

1. What does this have to do with a cough? How/why would these start at the same exact time?
2. Why does she have so much mucous secretion into her throat now?
3. Why the first vet did a fluid IV to help with her dehydration, she was able to lift her head and sit up, so why did that work?
4. She isn't crying, whimpering or anything, so how do we know she's in pain?

The vet is talking to us about putting her down, but I feel like they are missing something. Something doesn't feel right.

She was fine for the longest time, and now, all of a sudden she has a spinal issue and cough? Fine on a Monday and terribly sick on a Tuesday from a spinal issue?

I asked they to test for vestibular issues, but she doesn't have the rapid eye movement, so they ruled it out. I don't understand why they don't try the meds for that, and if it helps, great. If not, we can say we tried something else.

It originally started because he has allergies as well as an anxiety thing, but as he's gotten older it's become more of an obsessive sort of licking that I haven't been able to train out of him. He'll lick his feet now for just about any reason, from being left alone to being jealous that his cousins or sister are getting more attention than him.  A few days ago when we had to leave him alone with my brother for about an hour he licked his feet to the point of making himself vomit. Before this incident, he would leave large wet spots on whatever he was lying on at the time, and will obsessively lick the second he can't see you. I have booties that he wears on occasion, but they're outdoor ones that he uses due to being a baby and refusing to poop if the ground is too wet. I've tried using creams and medications (he's currently taking Benadryl) to help with his allergies, as well as sprays and distractions to direct him towards his toys instead, but nothing has seemed to help. I walk him and his sister regularly, so I know it's not that he's bored or not getting enough exercise. I've been trying to find booties or socks for him to wear when he's alone to prevent him from licking, but most are similar to the ones I've bought previously that are for outdoors. I've tried socks before, but they wouldn't really stay on his feet and seem to mostly be made for small dogs, so I ended up returning them.

My 2.5 year old, 63 pound Pit mix was diagnosed to weeks ago with a strained CCL. We followed the vet recommendations with only one slip up (she snuck past me when letting my other dog into the yard) and yesterday ended her two week exercise restriction. 

Well, she ran once around the yard and tore her CCL. The vet suggested surgery.  He does the ‚Äúolder method‚Äù which through his description sounds like the extracapsular imbrication technique. There will be a 12 week healing period.

We‚Äôre planning on doing the surgery, but I‚Äôm curious about the long term. I know she has a high chance of tearing the other CCL. She might have a limp and develop arthritis.

DogCare,g6gn81,meowhappypenguin,1,How could I handle this situation or would it be a good idea? I have 2 dogs and planning to get another one and I don‚Äôt want to cause any negative reaction with my 2 boys.,"I actually have 2 dogs: a 9 years old Chihuahua boy and a 5 years old Boston Terrier boy.

Both are actually good boys. I have a more intimate relation with the Chihuahua because we have been together longer. And my Boston Terrier is actually the sweetest boy I have ever met since he is the most noble dog on earth.

I‚Äôm planning on getting another dog, with obviously the intention of giving lots of love and care as I actually do with my two boys; but I also wanted to work on with the other dog as a therapy or assistance dog. 

I‚Äôm actually a psychology student and I have as well many mental health issues that I have to work on. I know that the process to provide a good training to the third dog will take lots of time and dedication, something that I‚Äôm more than happy to try.

Maybe you are thinking, why I don‚Äôt consider one of my actual dogs? I love them more than anything but unfortunately their personalities are not compatible with the ‚Äúdog job‚Äù.

The Chihuahua, even if we have that intense connection, he is actually a dog with a terrible behavior in the way that he hates people and it might turn him really violent. 

The Boston Terrier it‚Äôs definitely very sweet and also he is very good with people and other dogs; but his good character and the attention he gets, turns him into a crazy dog who doesn‚Äôt realize that with all the excited he gets, he ends being really intense and harmful without realizing. And also he is a dog who is scared of many things like most of the sounds, the darkness and some animals.

Both have been with me since they were puppies and I never ever have mistreated them or allow anyone else to do anything against them. I have taken an excellent care of them in many ways even if I work full time and I also am a full time student.  

I definitely tried to provide a good training which worked but not completely basically because of their personalities but anyway, we are still working on many things.

My worry is that I don‚Äôt want to cause any negative effect or feeling on my boys, I don‚Äôt want them to get the idea that I‚Äôm abandoning them because of the other dog or that I‚Äôm changing them or that I don‚Äôt love them anymore. Specially because I will be spending more time with the new dog.

When the Boston Terrier arrived home, 5 years ago, the Chihuahua got really mad, at the point that I when he first saw him, he vomited and started with a terrible le behavior; which is ended when I gave both the space to bond and I showed him that he was still my special boy and I had more than enough love to give both. 

The Chihuahua also has gotten sick from stomach problems because of the time he gets extremely temperamental. And he can easily attack people for no reason, just because he doesn‚Äôt like them and never stop barking.

The Boston Terrier, on the other hand, loves to be a naughty boy and do things he knows that he can‚Äôt and also I have a big big scar on my arm of on time he was very very playful and happy.

I am thinking of getting a West Highland Terrier girl as a third dog.

We‚Äôve gone before to another vet a couple months ago and he told us that she just has allergies so we would take her in to get a shot every couple weeks. But, that didn‚Äôt seem to work because her symptoms were getting worse and worse. Now, the vet we just went to 2 weeks ago has put her on antibiotics, ear ointment, and has us use a special shampoo. The itching has decreased and her skin is healing (which is great news) but now she‚Äôs had a shift in her behavior. She stays up very late at night sitting staring at nothing and panting. I try to sit next to her and pet her to calm her down but it doesn‚Äôt work. Sometimes she‚Äôll sneak upstairs (which my Dad doesn‚Äôt let her do but when I‚Äôm home she‚Äôs sneaky about it) and she‚Äôll lean her body against me and sit and pant. Idk if she‚Äôs developed some kind of anxiety disorder from her medication but it‚Äôs making me really worried.

Age: 17 months

Sex/Neuter Status: Boy, fixed

Breed: Cane Corso

Body Weight: 120 pounds

Clinical signs: Cherry Eye/Follicular Conjunctivitis

Duration: 8 months

Symptoms: Big mass of tissue protruding, discharge, now white spot on eye

My pup got poked in the eye by a little kid when he was about 5 months old maybe. Since then, he has gotten a really bad case of red tissue popping out of that eye. The other eye has some visible tissue, but I think that's normal for a big saggy dog like him. We took him to a vet that said it was cherry eye, and scheduled surgery.

They put him to sleep and called us an hour later saying that they were not going to do surgery because it was actually Follicular Conjunctivitis, and they gave us eye drops (Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Dexamethasone Opthalmic Suspension is what the bottle says). We used them 3 times a day for a week and saw no improvement, we even called to get another bottle sent.

We then made another appointment at another vet, they told us it was Cherry Eye again and to just get the surgery. We scheduled, but it got cancelled because of the pandemic.

Since then, I have noticed a white spot forming on his eye. I have also noticed that the tissue in both eyes is more red and sticks out more when he has been playing for a while or goes on a walk. The cloudy spot on his eye is almost reflective.

I can post a blurry picture of the cloudy spot and the tissue if it might be of use.",1,1587535908

He has a ton of energy, is very dog friendly, and loves going to the dog park. His fav activity there is running with/chasing the bigger dogs even though he is only 12 lbs. He has become best friends with a hound/lab mix 4 times his size and they run and wrestle together at least once a week at the park. However, as he has gotten more confident around other dogs and is initiating play more frequently and more roughly, I have started noticing that I will find scrapes up and down the insides and outsides of his hind legs when we get home from the park. I know this breed has thin skin that makes them more susceptible to breaking skin during play, and I watch him closely at the park and know it is not from other dogs biting him, he just ends up skidding across the ground and bouncing off of objects in the park in his derpy attempt to keep up with the big dogs. I do not want to stop taking him to the park if possible as I live in an apartment and really value him having the chance to run freely and socialize. He also never seems to notice the scrapes. However, I am also concerned about him getting banged up this frequently, right now he has several scabbed over spots up and down his back legs in various states of healing.

He has this really odd habit though that I've never seen in my life even having had 2 dogs. He will scratch his ear and then lick the hell out of his paw that he used. If you scratch the inside of his ear, he will fall in love with you for about 5 seconds and then insist on licking your hand.

I assume his ears are itchy just because of allergies since it is allergy season. However, I can't for the life of me figure out why this dog loves the taste of his inner ear. Any ideas?",4,1586758938

DogCare,fywmsr,forktothevocalcords,1,Dog lipoma during lockdown and quarantine,"Hey, so my labrador retriever of the age 6 years is suddenly not able to walk properly due to a mass that's growing on the left side of his tail that has become the size of a small rubber ball. Before the coronavirus lockdown when he was shown to the vet, he suggested that it was just a fat lipoma and nothing to worry about, but after countless Google searches and what not I realised that it could be malignant and cancerous and also burst in certain instances. I don't have dandelion to give him right now, and nothing that I can go out of my way and do. I read that lipomas occur because of the fats that don't get digested properly and settle in the walls of other parts of the body, so I considered getting his weight loss done at home itself by giving him rigorous exercise. Today I wondered if rigorous exercise would cause the lipoma to burst. Since all the vet clinics are temporarily closed right now and travelling is forbidden here, I have no option but to holistically try to treat him with the tools I have at hand right now, and I don't have a lot.

So I've had this little dog since she was a puppy; she's about 12 years old now. She used to be SO friendly, just loved everyone and wanted to be pet.

Something must have happened a few years ago (maybe 5 years ago?) when she just lost her little mind. EVERYTHING at home scares her. Anything that moves, anything that makes noise. She's absolutely terrified of thunder and fireworks, which leave her shaking and crying. She flinches when I touch her but I've never hurt her in her life!

Outside of the house, she's really aggressive. She wants to attack people and other dogs, which makes it really hard for me to leave the house with her. It's not just a non-threatening bark, either. Strays and dogs who get out of their yards have come up and she's tried to attack them, even when they're like 5x her size. I'm afraid I'm gonna get bit or she's gonna get mauled some day because I won't be able to stop a dog fight.

Overall she makes it seem like she's been abused or something but I've had her since she was a puppy and I've never hurt her! My other dog is perfectly normal (not scared of anything at all, and very rarely aggressive toward people). I've been living with the craziness for a long time but I just don't think I can take it anymore; she attacked my other dog in the middle of the night which made me want post this. She just keeps getting worse, I've never owned a dog like this before so I'm at a complete loss right now.

DogCare,fupjcu,AntiquePen,1,Could the quarantine be undoing the work we've done on separation anxiety?,"Last summer we adopted Zeke. He was a year-ish old half beagle who had some serious separation anxiety. With time we got him to be comfortable spending days in the living room.

When I went back to work, we started a routine of two days a week at a daycare with staff experienced with rescues. He was never aggressive just preferred to hide. Eventually he loved it. Since then he'd stop howling on days we left for work or to run errands.

Just before COVID-19 hit America I was laid off. We kept the daycare routine up so he wouldn't be alone during errands. My partner traveled and his work asked him to work from home before self-quararentine really took hold. They moved everyone to move from home before his personal quarantine was up. A week or two after that the state asked all non-essentials to shut down, so daycare did.

Basically our dog hasn't really been alone in months. We got some groceries and he seemed ok. He didn't protest while we were gone, and baby cam showed him snoozing on the couch. I'm starting to worry that his anxiety will reel back when this all stops. 

Is there anything we can do in the meantime to prevent this from happening? Leaving the house ""for funsies"" just isn't an option, our region had quite a few cases of COVID. Usually we baby crate him in the living room, but our place is so small he would still know we were close-by and wouldn't get so worried. Any other ideas?",3,1585986052

I had to go abroad for 2 weeks and i returned about 3 weeks ago. Twix had to stay home with my 2 brothers as it was a short trip and we didnt have time to set his documents up beforehand. Twix has been very protective since my return, its getting out of hand. 2 days ago he encountered a husky (hes very afraid of very big dogs) and that night i woke up to him at 2am having what im guessing was an anxiety attack triggered by barking outside. We live on the 20th floor, so as you can imagine the noise is very faint however he can still hear it. His symptoms include: severe shaking, crying, panting, refusing to move (i try to force him to sit down but his muscles are tensed) 

I have a floor to ceiling window with a roller blind. I usually leave a bit of the bottom open so he can still watch the outside -he loves doing that- but ive recently stopped after whats happening. I cover the sides of the blind with his crate and my skateboard however he still moves his crate and goes to sit between the window and the blind. It is 2am as im writing this, i was supposed to be asleep 2 hours ago. I have resorted to trying his leash to the top of my headboard (long enough to lay down, short enough to not reach the sides of the bed incase an accident happens) and playing calming music to cover up any outside sounds, and although he stopped crying 70% he still is panting and shaking. If i let him off the leash he keeps wandering the room crying and barking, so id prefer to keep it on until i find a solution. Should i tape the sides of the blind to my wall so he cant go between it and the wall? Should i ignore his crying or is that damaging? What should i do?

DogCare,fkvq3x,myspiritisvantablack,1,"What to give dog, if they can't eat kibble w/ grains?","Hello,


I have an almost 2 years old shiba and I, like most other pet owners, want what is absolute best for my little beast. So I've been diving into the world of pet food yet again, since I keep reading conflicting statements about all the different kinds of pet food. Raw food isn't shown to be more effective, grainfree can cause DCM, regular kibble can cause other problems, etc. etc.

To begin with we had him eat Royal Canin kibble, but when he grew out of his young puppy-food, we tried out various kibble all with bad results. He had constant diarrhoea or loose stools. Since we didn't have great success with any kibble that included grains (including anallergenic kibble), despite slowly easing it in at every switch, we finally gave him grain-free food and that has worked so far. Then I started to worry about the grainfree food, as apparently it can agitate DCM.

So my question is: what on earth do I do, now that grainfree is the only alternative he doesn't get loose stools from, but it also isn't good in the long run? Any suggestions? Anybody has experience with similar circumstances?",17,1584560520

Watched some Neonatal care video from YouTube and it really helped.

I am incapable of accessing pet feeds because of the Corona Virus lockdown. I live in a complicated rural area border between 3 cities and because of the nature of the place, its harder to get in and out of this village. The pet shops here don't have stuff for puppies and are mostly barn feeds and pet food for grown dogs.

I was however given by a relative some Promil Gold for 4 years old and up. I was told ""Just dilute it. Might work. Better to have puppies with an upset stomach than them dying of hunger"".

Is this a viable option? Is this gonna end stilting their growth?",7,1584554876

She is now 6 months old and I know what she is and isn't comfortable with. We take her on walks to a recreation park and she is very curious about smells however she is VERY SHY to any person or dog of any age who approaches. She hides behind me or my BF and takes a long time to warm up to them. Also when she is in my tiny car she DROOLS like a waterfall. Im not sure if this is stress of sickness from poor visibility. When we take her to the DOG park she is still very shy and drools the entire time (she dosnt do that at home). She dose have 1 friend!

DogCare,fhs7qc,serial_hobbyist93,1,Best dog harness for a dog that is seemingly a reincarnation of Houdini?,"So as my title suggests, my 1yr old cockalier boy has a history of being an escape artist when it comes to his dog harnesses, which has led me to have extreme anxiety about walking him on my own. A change in circumstances means I don't have my walking buddy every day now, and this has so far led to my boy not being able to be taken out as often as he should. He's a high energy, intelligent dog, so this can cause havoc at home.

I'm not sure of the previous harnesses he's had as they were purchased by someone else, but his current is this: https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/canada-pooch-everything-dog-harness-black-medium

In terms of issues I've had with this and the previous harnesses:

1- ""Twistability"". As the current harnesses straps are not completely fixed to the chest and back plate and allow movement through the loops, he manages to twist around until he can basically get a leg out and wriggle free. 

2- length. He's got a slightly longer body than average, which means it always seems that the back end of his harness always seems to fit just at the deepest point of his ribcage, and is prone to sliding forward because of it.

I know a big part of moving forward with this issue is going to be retraining him to have better manners on a walk, and addressing my anxiety (Both of which are in progress, though I welcome any training tips!), But I feel I'd be a lot more comfortable if he had a harness that was impossible for him to wriggle free of on a walk!

DogCare,fgu2gg,kattarhali,1,Dog with separation anxiety,"So, my dog has some major separation anxiety. We've had him for about 6 months. We believe we know why he has it (we're his third family and he's only 3 years old). Whenever someone leaves the house/comes home he starts barking and running around, somewhat normal I suppose. But when I leave even just the room he follows me around. That I can deal with, but if I leave the house, all hell breaks loose. 

We can't leave him alone in the house. The one and only time we did, before we realized he had anxiety, he ended up breaking a second floor window (he didn't get hurt). A few days later we tried crate training and my husband left the room for 6 minutes band he busted though the crate. It was one of the all metal ones, which I know now aren't the best, but still. Either way, we can't leave him alone, so someone always has to be home with him.

We plan on taking him to the vet or someone who specializes in dog behavior, but are there any tips or little things I can do until then?",4,1583916383

DogCare,fgmihc,a_small_goat,1,Decoding OCD-ish Behavior in a Herding Dog,"I'm not necessarily looking to address this behavior, just understand where it comes from so that when someone asks ""What's wrong with your dog?"" I can do more than shrug. Or maybe I *should* be addressing it? I don't know - that's why I'm posting I guess.

I have a 1.5-year old border collie who, every morning, will very carefully movie four pieces of kibble from his bowl to the bottom of the stairs on the other side of the house. It is very deliberate, it's always four pieces - one on the first (landing) step and three on the second step - and he always sweeps the pieces into the corner of the step against the wall. I go to work, I come home, and they are still there. Every. Single. Day.

Only when I give him dinner will he go back and eat them and he always eats his ""stash"" first. I can literally pour food in front of him, release him, and he'll head straight for his stash. Could not care less what is in the bowl in front of him.  I have tried to feed the pieces to him a couple times but he just takes them in his mouth and sits there until he has an opening to go put them back where they ""belong"". If I clean them up before I leave for work, I come home to four more pieces in the exact same arrangement.

He doesn't attempt to ""bury"" them. He shows no signs of food aggression towards people or dogs. He doesn't appear to show any behaviors that indicate anxiety, stress, or boredom. He has some other OCD-like behaviors (e.g. where he places his toys and in what order he brings them to people) so I am wondering if this is just an aspect of herding breeds? Is this the *start* of a behavioral issue? Is he trying to communicate something? I don't know - food dish placement, kibble flavor, kibble shape...? Is it some sort of offering to the upright vacuum god and he's ultimately disappointed they aren't accepting it?

Is he just weird?",0,1583879639

DogCare,ffvgci,Denzy,1,Grain-free &amp; High Protein food,"We have a 3.5 year old Greater Swiss and a 12 year old Entlebucher Mountain Dog. When we were training our Swissy, our trainer recommended switching her to Wellness Core food, which is high protein and grain free. She also recommended this for our older dog. We did some research online and a lot of people seemed to recommend the grain free diet, so we went with that for a year or so.

I recently took our older dog in to the Vet, and she strongly recommended AGAINST anything high protein or grain free, especially for our older dog. She told us that he should be on a more senior dog food, and it should not be grain free. He should also stay away from high protein for his kidneys. She also recommended that we put our Swissy on something that is not grain free as well, and recommended 4 brands for us to look into:

* Hill's Science
* Royal Canin
* Purina
* Eukanuba 

We thought we were doing right by our pups by getting them premium high-protein food recommended by our trainer, but I am more inclined to side by our vet. My question is, if grain-free diets made my vet cringe so hard hearing I feed my dogs with it, why are they so popular/recommended? Also, does anyone have any feedback regarding the brands I have mentioned above? We tried Purina when our Swissy was much younger and her poo was always a non-solid mess before switching over to Wellness.",11,1583764040

TLDR:  Dog has extreme dandruff, have tried different shampoos and some  dietary changes but unsure how help cure it. any recommendations  welcomed.

I have a 16 week old  female golden retriever with a severe dandruff problem. She has had it  since we picked her up. She was freshly bathed, so it wasn't as bad, but  it seems to have gotten worse.

We've  tried burt's bees oatmeal shampoo and human head + shoulders. The H+S  seems to help but after a few days/a week, it comes back. We didn't  bathe her for the first month we had her, and have given her a bath on  each of the past 2 saturdays to try and help calm her dandruff (i know  excessive baths can dry her skin out, but it seems her skin is extremely  dry and flaky anyway.)

FWIW,  we've added a full hardboiled egg yolk to her diet once a day for the  last 2 weeks or so, and have gotten some salmon jerky treats for high  value treats during training. As far as her diet, the breeder sent us  home with some food for her (blue buffalo i believe, but unsure), but  she didn't really eat it and has been on hills science diet for large  breed puppy (chicken meal and oats recipe) for the last 8 or so weeks  (since 1/23 or 1/24).

We‚Äôve made it through the two week system of meds and have been diligent about cleaning and are hopeful that it‚Äôs run it‚Äôs course, but on the last night of his meds after a big poop before bed he threw up late night/early morning.  He was completely fine (if not more energetic and affectionate) than usual but we panicked and called our vet to set up and appointment, which based on the facts they didn‚Äôt set up and instead had a phone call with me to talk the issues through.  I stayed home from work to monitor him, worried that he might have a blockage and while he burped a bit and slept a lot nothing seemed to be the matter.  We were worried that he might have a blockage so fed him smaller meals often over the course of the day and stayed away from the high energy training we normally do, more obedience and a bit of tug when he got too pent up.  He pooped twice, once around 10am and again before bed and again seemed perfectly fine if not pleased that we were leaving him.  This morning we woke up to 3 piles of foamy, slimy bile vomit. 

We are admittedly helicopter parents but are trying to keep perspective since our vet (who we love) was not overly concerned when we spoke to her on the phone, and he‚Äôs thrown up before without us freaking out, but with the giardia and everything we‚Äôre on high alert and he‚Äôs never thrown up two nights in a row.

I went to let my other dogs out and came to to him stumbling out of the room visibly weak on the back legs. I don't even want to imagine how he managed to get down from the bed :(.

The vet run blood tests which came out normal. his weight came out normal. She thinks he had a seizure and sent him home with anti-inflammatories and pain killers. He's improved since then as in he can get up and walk short distances. A far cry from the dog he used to be before.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm doubtful about the seizure diagnosis because he had been slowing down for a couple of months now. He's been falling behind during walks and he's been sleeping a lot more.

&amp;#x200B;

He's been poisoned (I had a huge falling out with someone who lives near me and he may have retaliated against me. My dog would eat anything and spends a lot of time in the yard.)

He had some lipomas on his body, could they be pushing against a nerve or something similar? They are diagnosed as lipomas with a biopsy.

In the last 6 months or so we've noticed he's had a harder time holding his pee. He used to never have a problem, but now we have to take him out like 3 or 4 times after eating (over the course of a couple hours) or else he will run around peeing. We asked the vet about this and he felt he was just getting old and we need to monitor how much water we're giving him (we used to just leave his bowl always full and he'd drink as needed). So we have adjusted to just taking him out more often.

This morning, however, I got concerned. I was about to take him out for a walk before going to work, and he collapsed to the floor shaking (in a very awkward way) and peed all over himself. After he peed he was fine, though you could tell he was embarrassed because he didn't want to look at me or get up. Once I comforted him though he got right up and we walked outside. But the way he kinda fell to the floor shaking has me very worried. I called the vet but they can't see him today.

DogCare,f7wzsl,Bfish47,1,My dog only eats for me,"I'm at a loss for what to do here.

My family and I have a small breed of dog called a Cavachon, half Bichon Frise and half Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. He is around 10 years old now. For most of his life he's been a totally normal, happy dog, though he's always been pretty timid and skittish. We recently found out that he had very bad tooth decay, and had to take him to the vet to get most of his teeth pulled. Since then we've been feeding him mostly baby food, cooked meat, and this dehydrated vegetable mixture that you add hot water to. However, ever since this operation, he has become terrified of both of my parents, but especially of my mom.

He always had a so-so relationship with her, didn't hate her or anything, but she wasn't his favorite. I think this was because she was the one who mostly took care of him when he was sick, and he associated her with the badness of that. But now it's on a whole different level. He runs away from her as soon as she comes close, and if he can't then he starts shaking uncontrollably. And if she is the one to give him food, he refuses to eats it and runs away when she's out of sight. He usually won't eat for my dad either, but isn't as afraid of him. He pretty much only eats from me. I think this is due to the fact that they were the ones who brought him to and from the vet, whereas I wasn't involved with that process.

The main reason this is a problem is because I'm not going to be living here for much longer. I pretty recently graduated from college, and am only living with my parents temporarily. When I move out, I'm not going to be in a position to take him with me. It's been almost a month since this procedure and he's barely warmed up to them at all.

I really just want to know if anyone here has experienced something like this with their dogs, and might have some advice as to how they can gain his trust again.",3,1582398068
DogCare,f7b7l4,Jigglypuff2cute,1,How do you handle around the clock care?,"My dog had bladder stones removed and the vet said that she needs to pee every 2 hours for 10 days so she doesn't open her bladder. I don't have a job (i live with my parents) so I thought I could do it. But its been 2 days now. I forgot that I can be a heavy sleeper so im afraid of going to bed and not waking up by the alarm. Once I get at least 5 or 6 hours of sleep then I can start waking up by the alarm but with only 2 i may reach the deep sleep and not be able to wake up again for so many hours. My youngest brother has school so he cant really take care of her at night. My other brother doesn't really care and he might fall asleep while watching videos on his phone. My parents are both working at night and as soon as they come home theyre too tired from work to stay awake for that long so they have to go to bed soon. My dad usually has to get up to go make sure my grandma eats something in the afternoon but then he goes back to bed when he gets home. My has trouble staying awake at home and usually cant even sit on the computer for too long without falling asleep especially if she has to go grocery shopping (almost everyday), checks up on my grandma or has to go get a bill paid.

DogCare,f1k1f7,ACDoggo717,1,Hip Dysplasia and Sudden Onset of Symptoms?,"Hi all,

tl;dr i am looking to see if anyone has had a dog with hip dysplasia that suddenly had symptoms onset in a young 2 year old dog, rather than a gradual onset.

&amp;#x200B;

I adopted a dog about 6 months ago, his paperwork claimed he is a golden retriever/australian shepherd mix, but I dont really see either of those breeds in him. He looks more like a carolina dog mixed with some kind of shepherd. I plan to do a DNA test soon to know for sure, but he is a \~45lb and now 2.25 year old athletic dog. This morning, while out for our morning walk, I noticed a hesitance to put weight on his left hind leg while beginning to sit down and then he settled on his right hip. This behavior has continued throughout the day. He can walk fine and still jumps on the furniture, but is slow to rise from resting and is in some discomfort. I took him into the vet and they thought nothing too much of it but noticed the discomfort too and plan to take x-rays. He's been going to day care recently and had been romping around for two days straight with other dogs, Thursday and Friday. Saturday, he had no discomfort that I noticed, we had a dog obedience class that he did well in and then came around a few breweries with me, where he greeted lots of other dogs and people with seemingly no issues.

I take my dog running with me, usually keeping the mileage between 3-6 miles and he does great, I'm always the one huffing and puffing behind my pacesetter - we typically go 7:30/8 minute miles. I love having a running buddy. Hiking is also a big hobby for me and the few times I got to go with my dog before the weather turned, he absolutely loved it. 

The fact that the vet immediately recommended x-rays has me freaked out, for sure, at the thought of my little guy having hip dysplasia and the quality of his life going down from it. I am really hoping that because of the sudden onset of symptoms and his age that he maybe just strained something and simply needs rest, but I am also fearing the worst. I've been going through all of my photos and videos of him. Most of the videos his gait seems normal, no bunny hopping, but I do have some \~2-3 month old photos of him doing the ""sloppy sit"" as well as many photos of him sitting properly. One thing I have noticed is running up stairs, he tended to always land on his right hind leg prior to placing pressure on his left. It was pretty subtle though and he had no issues launching off of the left hind leg, nor any issues running up and down the stairs in excitement. He loves to race up and down stairs and was doing this as early as Friday evening. 

Have any of you had  a dog become diagnosed with dysplasia and have symptoms like a limp just suddenly appear?",5,1581303951

With no xray or further testing, we were told it was a possible ACL tear (he‚Äôs a 9 year old lab). He was given pain meds, and an anti inflammatory medication. Surgery was suggested in a few months. I know the drugs make him sleepy, to the point he will drool when he sleeps which he has never done before, and he isnt as active. One of the side effects of the pain med is sedation, so I‚Äôm not worried. I try to keep him in our bedroom, because it has carpet and he slips easily on the wooden floor. I come and lay with him and help feed him, which he loves.

My boyfriend and I are currently figuring out what to do. The surgery is very expensive, so for the time being I‚Äôm keeping him rested, giving him medication, and limiting as much movement as possible. I even got him some supporting hock braces, (similar to a knee brace a human wears) just to wear when he goes to the bathroom.

I‚Äôm starting to feel guilty about keeping him rested and away from everything. I know in my heart, this is the best option till we can get surgery of any kind. But I feel bad. I know it‚Äôs silly, but my dog has had free range his whole 9 years so, now that he‚Äôs limited I know it‚Äôs killing him.

Any reassurance or advice?

However, when my roommate  gets home her dog gets much more aggressive and possessive of toys, his space, food, etc., and will actively run after and try to attack my dog when she is walking on the other side of the room and not even engaging with him.

DogCare,ey5z3j,beezie96,1,Dog won't eat his food,"Hi! We have a 9 year old male shetland sheepdog. He is otherwise completely healthy and we take him to the vet regularly. We adopted him a year ago, and it has been a huge struggle just getting him to eat a little bit of food. When he eats his poop is usually normal, and he is still happy and active all the time. We have looked him over many times, the vets have checked pretty much everything, and we can't find a reason why he's not eating. We change his food regularly, he eats for a few days after we get a new kind, and then he pretty much stops. He eats a little bit every day, but not nearly enough to keep his weight. The only thing that works is putting PB, treats or cooked meat in his food, but then he always gets diarrhea. It seems the only thing his tummy can handle is the dry food you get in bags at the vet (sorry, English is not my first language and I don't know what it's called), which is also what the vet recommends. Any super clever tips to make him eat more? He gets food two times a day, and we usually leave it out if he doesn't eat it right away, then we change it for his next meal if he still hasn't eaten anything. Dunno if it's an international brand, but we feed him Acana dog food.",10,1580730295

Obviously the first solution is to get food in him on time(like a handful at bedtime) but as they say, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.

There have been mornings where we let him out to pee first thing, and within a minute of coming inside he pukes, leaving us no time to feed him.

As a human, if my stomach is a little wonky, I try sucking on a peppermint and that usually helps.

DogCare,ewf0wo,DtownMaverick,4,Trying to decide whether or not to give my puppy his heart medications or let him die peacefully and would appreciate any input if you've had heart problems with your dog.,"My 2 year old husky mix was just diagnosed with DCM last month and has been on 5 medications for the past couple weeks. Before his diagnosis (we went in with a completely unrelated issue and that's when the doctor first told me about the heart issues) he had been showing no symptoms and was happy, playful, energetic. The only indication of any heart issues was his heartbeat was always really strong, way stronger than any other dog I ever saw, but no vet ever mentioned it before so I never thought too much of it. 

Since he's been on the meditations he's got a lot less energy and seems miserable. Also, his heart now beats in an irregular rhythm, I'm pretty sure that's one of the medications doing that because it's really obvious and even I would have been able to tell something was wrong a long time ago if it had been happening before.

So my question is if DCM is a fatal condition anyways, would it be better to stop his medicine, at least as long as he's symptom free, and let him live out the rest of his life happy rather than forcing him to take the medicine and feel bad. If it's going to make a significant impact on his lifespan I'll of course do it but if it's not going to be much difference I'd rather he lives a shorter but happier life. I'm more concerned with his quality of life than his lifespan. If anyone's been through the same thing with their dog is really appreciate your input, thanks.

Oh also, I made a conscious decision to not mention which medications, I'm not asking for medical advice, I understand it's on a case by case basis but I'm just looking for an overall picture of the efficacy of heart medications in dogs.",16,1580428603

She has somewhat recently started going to the bathroom inside the house, even when we are standing right next to her. That is the really weird part. I let her out right when I get up in the morning, and again before I leave for work. Right when I get home, a little later, and right before bed. Sometimes she has seizures, so we definitely want her to have an empty bladder, to minimize the mess. Maybe once every three weeks to a month, and they don't last long. Sometimes she'll have one while we are gone. But when she squats on a rug, when we are right by her, that seems weird! She doesn't seem to do it when we are gone. Maybe she is also drinking more water when we are home and combined with an infection?

She is a mix of what looks like blue heeler and long hair terrier. My wife said they thought the mom was chihuahua?  She is about 4 1/2 years old. Anyway, any tips for collecting a urine sample?

DogCare,esg3hq,TCMJohn,1,I've been looking into canine dementia and thought I would share some research,"There is a lot of talk about human cognitive issues, but what about dogs?

A lot of owners of dogs with doggie dementia don't recognize the symptoms of this condition because they can be subtle and begin gradually. Sometimes other dogs can notice before owners do.

Sometimes dementia can result in behavioral changes - barking or aggression for example. But it can be hard to pinpoint the root cause, even with tests and lab visits.

Research shows that 85% of cases of cognitive dysfunction syndrome in dogs go undiagnosed. There are different forms of this condition too. One form, involutive depression, is like human depression with symptoms like circling around, wandering, and going the bathroom indoors. Your dog might seem extra sleepy, have trouble sleeping, learn slower, or even make less noise.

Another type called dysthymia results in dogs losing a sense of their size. They can get stuck places, aggression, growling, whining, or affected sleep.

Yet another type is hyper-aggression, where dogs become very aggressive towards other dogs without warning. A final type is called confusional syndrome, which is like Alzheimer's - they don't seem to learn, they forget people and pets, and even their owners.

Luckily, there are supplements that can help with doggie dementia:

Omega 3s are a great place to start, and often dogs don't get enough omega 3s in their diet. 

Vitamin C, L-Carnitine, and Vitamin E can be helpful as well!

DogCare,erc3l2,Monkoodog,1,"What‚Äôs the Reason of Increasing Obesity in Dogs, and How to Solve it","Obesity is not only prominent in humans, but it is equally suffered by animals, and pets are more liable to be obese than any other domestic or wild animal. Obesity in dogs is mainly inspired by poor dieting and lack of body exercise. Dogs should be kept agile and fit, it is in the owner‚Äôs interest to create an exercise schedule for his four-legged friend, this will help improve the health state of the dog and keep her far from becoming overweight.

However, sickness in dogs can also inspire obesity, when a dog suffers from arthritis, she naturally withdraws from physical exercise, and when her physical activity is minimized, obesity begins to set in.

The earlier the disease is treated, the better. When your dog falls sick, don‚Äôt delay her treatment, make haste and ensure that necessary medical measures are taken to cure the sickness, because obesity is bound to visit if your dog persists in her habit of continually resting on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

The treatment process will help you understand how obesity can be combated. To get the desired result, you are advised to follow these steps exactly.

1. Set a daily target for your dog; to stop obesity in dogs, you need to increase their activity level, keep the dog busy with exercise and watch her burn those calories. You can take the dog out on a walk every day, find the time that is most appropriate for you, you can schedule a morning walk, or an evening exercise, whichever works for you.
2. Stop the dog from eating foods that contain excess fat and carbohydrates; look for alternative meals with lesser calories. See that the dog‚Äôs caloric intake is controlled.
3. Visit a vet for a proper diagnosis. Ensure that the dog takes her medication as prescribed. Your veterinarian can assist you in creating a diet plan for the dog, plus recommendations on how you can control caloric intake of the dog.

DogCare,epctvc,LXL79,1,CBD making my dog more anxious?,"Hi all,

My dog (a five-year old Cockapoo) has pretty bad separation anxiety on a normal day, and it's gotten worse since we moved to a new apartment.  One vet in the past has told us to medicate her, but we didn't feel comfortable with that choice at the time.  For now, we wanted to try a more natural route, thus the CBD.  We've also spent the past five years trying to train the anxiety out of her to varying levels of success.

My question is that we are currently dosing her three times a day with a dropper full (about 8-10 drops) of 125mg of CBD oil.  We've been doing it for a little over a week now (started with 5 drops then slowly up to 10 drops).  However, since we haven't seen any affect yet, we upped it to about 15-18 drops today.  She had two doses so far and her anxiety seems suddenly much worse.  She won't stop following me around and jumps at the slightest noise (she has a noise phobia, particularly to clicking sounds).  Did we give her too much?  Or too much too fast?  Is this a common reaction to CBD?  Should we up the strength to 250mg and give her less drops?

As with humans, dogs prefer to receive loving and touching in certain areas of the body, while others find it annoying. What is this about? We'll tell you then!

## How to know if your dog feels uncomfortable touching his paws?

For some owners, it is clear that their dog does not like to touch his paws. It may show signs of discomfort that you have not noticed:  
‚¶Å Lower his ears  
‚¶Å Hide the leg or press it on his hand.  
‚¶Å Start licking the area nervously.  
‚¶Å Start staring at you, even if he's lying down.

DogCare,eookao,Gone_Green2017,1,Is it normal for our vet to not know what's wrong with our dog?,"First time posting, and I'm on mobile if that matters...

Two weeks ago, my 3 year old golden retriever stopped eating. She wasn't having bowel movements. We took her to the vet, where they diagnosed her with a miscarriage. She had a 104¬∞ fever and an ultrasound showed her uterus was inflamed. They sent us home with antibiotics, a fluid pak, and antiinflammatories, with a recheck in two days.

Two days later, her fever was at 101¬∞. She still wasn't eating or having bowel movements. They decided to keep her to give her fluids, a steroid injection, and to test for Addison's disease due to her having a high level of potassium in her blood work. The test came back so close that they called in a specialist for a consult but ultimately decided she didn't have Addison's disease. 

The steroid did wonders! She was eating, playing, and acting like her usual self. No fever. After four days, though, she woke me in the night throwing up and having diarrhea. She only vomited once, and only a small amount, but the diarrhea was pretty severe and persisted. We took her back to the vet.

They decided she had a pyometra and performed surgery to remove her uterus. While they were in, they also checked her colon and intestines for blockages and found none. However, they also said her uterus had been fine. They also did a fecal test and she doesn't have any parasites.

We're almost $2,000, two weeks, and a surgery into this and the vet still doesn't know what's wrong with our dog.... Is this normal? We want to do what's best for our girl, regardless of cost, but we're starting to worry.",11,1579023844

This is a picture of my Bella. She had surgery to remove her salivary glands which is why she has that large bump on her neck. She has been doing great ever since!

Bella had a pretty bad case of separation anxiety and after trying multiple things with a trainer, we saw our vet who recommended some vitamins for her anxiety including l-theanine and melatonin. We got them from a company called Chowjoy and they have been working great so far. 

Just thought I would share since we were getting pretty desperate and this worked out well for us.

My dog Mari (black/ f/8yr old) Staffordshire bull terrier is getting multiple tiny bald spots on one her hind legs. I would say it started to happening earlier this week. It was a faint little dot but now there‚Äôs multiple and it‚Äôs very noticeable. She hasn‚Äôt been scratching. Her diet is great. Drinks plenty of water and is semi-active. I know her fur has been getting slightly sparse due to age along with specks grey/white hair but this is concerning. Any advice would help.,2,1578966361
DogCare,eoa8nz,pharmtomed,1,"Dog getting overprotective to everyone but my wife and son, really starting to worry","Also posted this to /r/dogtraining but wanted to post here to try to get some advice. My wife and I are really stressing about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Little bit of a long story, but essentially my wife and I got a blue heeler pup in March of 2018, and moved about 3 months later. We had a child in June of 2019, and that's where the weirdness starts.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife's mom and grandma came to stay with us at our apartment for two weeks, and everything was fine. However, the day before they were going to leave, our dog jumped up on my wife's grandma as she was coming across the room to come grab our son so my wife could get up and go to the kitchen (no biting). This sort of becomes a pattern. We immediately kenneled him for a while and he returned to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, my mother in law came to stay with us again. This time, about halfway through her stay, she was walking towards my wife to come get our son from her, and our dog did the same thing - just a warning jump, and some barking afterwards. Again, we kenneled him for a little and he returned to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm a student, and recently returned to school after a break - during the break, I had to sleep on a separate bed from my wife due to space constraints at my in-laws. Two days ago (back at our apartment), when I was walking across the room to join my wife and son on the couch, our dog got up from his bed and did the same thing to me. This obviously rattled me, so we kenneled him to calm down and tried to see if he would repeat the behavior. Sure enough, today, he did the exact same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really worried. We've both been his owners since we got him, and I don't have to be away from home too often - maybe 3 days a week 4 hours each of those days. My wife did have a complicated pregnancy (in the hospital for 3 weeks), so I'm not sure if that was a catalyst or not, who knows. Our son is beginning to learn to stand and crawl, and we really don't want any complications with respect to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly, we just don't want to have to get rid of our dog. We love him very much. If anybody has any advice with regard to this over-protectiveness, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",29,1578949160

About once a month, my wife and I spend weekends with our parents who live about 2 hrs away. When doing these weekend trips, we want to bring a crate with us for our puppy to spend the nights in. However, the 42-inch wire crate we have will not fit in our car. What is the best solution?

DogCare,eo1584,Imat20,1,Can dogs eat yogurt? And is it Healthy?,"#  Can dogs eat yogurt? And is it Healthy? 

Many people ask us what foods are beneficial or harmful to their dogs, including yogurt.  The beginning of veterinary medicine, based mainly on the administration and supervision of food with beneficial properties for our dogs.

# What about yogurt? Can or can‚Äôt they eat it?

The answer is very simple and complex at the same time they can and cannot.  We will explain it in detail so that we can all understand how and when they can eat yogurt. Dogs cannot drink cow's milk, the lactose it contains is very harmful to them, it can cause diarrhea, vomiting, the appearance of parasites (worms) in their digestive tract and even important allergic reactions that can be very serious. Yogurt is a product that barely contains lactose, the bacteria that form yogurt itself are responsible for digesting the lactose in milk, so in scientific terms: A yogurt contains very small doses of lactose that do not have to cause problems To our dogs.

DogCare,een47e,pupcheeks,1,Adopted puppy needs multiple surgeries on both front legs. advice/support/vent,"First time posting, I really need some advice here. I adopted my boy Urkel almost a month ago, he‚Äôs my first dog I‚Äôve owned on my own as an adult and I absolutely love him to death. He‚Äôs my guy, and I want to give him the absolute best quality of life possible. That‚Äôs where this post comes in. 

Since bringing him home, I have been meeting with vets and talking with the rescue about his legs. He‚Äôs a pit bull mix, probably with basset hound. So, he has short stumpy front legs that are deformed and growing wrong. His legs are bowed out and paws splay outward. The surgeons are recommending to do a complicated surgery to cut the bones and put in screws and pins to straighten his legs. He‚Äôs only 5 1/2 months  so he needs to have the surgery ASAP, probably in about a week from now. After the first surgery, he‚Äôll need to have another surgery to possibly cut more bone out in a month since he‚Äôll be growing. It‚Äôs going to be very intensive and he‚Äôs going to need a ton of care and attention during healing (carrying, helping him walk with a harness or towel as he won‚Äôt be able to use his front legs). Of course I am willing to do whatever I need to do to help him. I want him to have the highest quality of life possible. I‚Äôm just so worried. I work almost full time and my boyfriend who I live with also works part time, so we won‚Äôt be home 24/7 to care for him. He‚Äôs used to sleeping in his kennel for part of the day while we are at work but I‚Äôm just worried about the whole healing process and if I‚Äôm going to be able to provide him with the care that he needs.  The rescue will be paying for the expenses of the surgery, so that‚Äôs not the issue. I‚Äôve just been trying to figure out if I‚Äôm going to be the best person to go through this with him. I have a history of depression and anxiety issues, and I wanted a dog in the first place as a support animal, and I‚Äôm a little worried that this is just going to make my issues worse in some way. I also work with dogs at a daycare facility, but I‚Äôm not going to be able to bring him to work with me if he‚Äôs recovering from a surgery, as it would be too stressful for him. Another reason I‚Äôm worried is because I‚Äôm going to be moving to a new apartment for February 1st so that‚Äôs going to be another layer of stress. So basically, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to deal with all of this. I don‚Äôt want to to return him back to the rescue, but I also want him to be in the best hand possible. I‚Äôm really just doubting myself a lot, but this is going to put a huge strain on my life so I‚Äôm worried. 

Is there anybody here who has had to deal with this type of thing, or knows anything about puppies going through surgery? I know it will be traumatic and could cause behavioural issues down the road. If anybody has any advice, I would be so grateful for it. 

Edit: Myself as well as the Rescue were not aware of his issues when I adopted him. I just thought he had wonky basset les, and didn‚Äôt realize it was so serious until I started meeting with surgeons and having xrays done.

tl;dr can be found below

My dog is about 15 years old, he's a small dog (likely toy poodle mix but not sure, he's a rescue). Recently he's been going more and more deaf, which I've heard is somewhat to be expected. The bigger issue is he seems like he may be in a lot of pain in his back. For the last day or so, he's seemed entirely hunched over with his tail tucked almost always. He doesn't react when I touch him lightly anywhere so I don't think it's a broken bone of any sort, however I am trying to be as gentle as humanly possible so who knows. My mom says she can feel a bump under the skin on his back but wasn't able to locate it today and I've seen no evidence of it. He just seems remarkably uncomfortable and today his back legs have been almost constantly shaking. He is also bowing his head and refusing to look upwards which is unlike him. I honestly don't know what information to provide but will be available if anyone has questions, or wants me to check anything in particular. Thanks so very much in advance if anyone has advice or what have you.

DogCare,eavwha,lisascotttt,1,Will She Be Okay?,"Hi, my issue is not so much physical health related as it is mental health. I (20) have had my lab- J for seven years and she is my everything. A couple of years ago, my sister (19) got a small poodle- A. We both still live with my parents. I regularly walked my dog three miles every evening and we played fetch for as long as she wanted each day. Since my sister got her dog, it has been impossible to keep that routine. A is very disobedient and my sister gives her no attention for training. Any progress I had made with my dog was completely undone when my sister got her dog. My parents have made it so difficult to walk my dog as they nag me forever if I do not take my sister‚Äôs dog as well. This wouldn‚Äôt be so unreasonable if my sister had ever taught her dog to walk or control her anger. But because the little one is so untrained she constantly attacks my very anxious dog while we walk and it becomes too stressful for me. The little one also does not allow my dog to play fetch as she bites my dogs tail until she gives up. It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I am ready to re-home the little one. But because the dogs have lived together for around three years now, I am worried that my dog will be upset when she leaves. Would she understand that it is for the better once her and I are able to walk everyday again and play fetch regularly? I am worried about her becoming depressed. Any advice? Have any of you dealt with something similar?

_Edit:_ 

 ""Why cant you just go to the vet where you live?""

Our town, which is VERY small, doesnt have any vets nor vet buildings nor clinics for dogs unfortunately. However our group of visitors who give the community pet supplies and vaccinate our dogs and puppies only come once or twice every year or two years. They come rarely. So we all would find other ways to support our pets.

So many of us would just order online or travel just to buy supplies, dog houses, dog care supplies for our pets. Sadly.

If you dont live where I live and dont understand how hard it is for us, yah, girl bye.

DogCare,e9ujz3,venturousviajera,1,Can I feed my dog by tossing him pieces of kibble as he jumps to catch them?,"Can I feed my dog by tossing him pieces of kibble? I do this with treats and he LOVES it. He's pretty good at it, and sometimes it's my fault on the throw if he doesn't catch. He's a rescue, and pretty nervous/cautious most of the time. Little else lights up his face than when he's being thrown a treat. 

I want to do more of what he likes, and get him more exercise as we live on the 2nd floor in an urban environment. (Running with him isn't ideal yet because he zig zags too much and wants to smell EVERYTHING).


I know exercise and feeding should be spaced apart, so is it even okay to give more than a few pieces at a time?  I always ask him to sit, then wait before tossing, so it's not just a confetti of food but sometimes he gets the zoomies in between tosses. I would move to balls or frisbees soon, but we're still working on basics, and he can tear through a tennis ball in seconds so I need to make sure we're safe and 'drop it' is solid.

Don't wanna get his stomach in a bind by feeding too much this way.

Hx: Adopted a 2y/o pitmix, 5 weeks ago. He was picked up as a stray, doesn't seem to know any commands or routines. He sleeps in a crate, and when I am at work. New Dog owner!

\--

Is it okay to leave my dog in the crate while I get ready in the morning, and for how long?

And for at least 30 minutes after I get home from work?

\--

I have to walk past his crate in the mornings, so I feel like a real jerk when I do not let him out right away. Even if it's just to go to the bathroom quickly.

But it is damn near impossible for me to adequately get ready in the mornings/shower/pack my lunch/do paperwork/get his food ready, etc.,if I let him out first thing. (still working on training, so he needs direct supervision and isn't safe if I just let him 'free' around the house) I've been struggling big time when I get him out before I am showered and/or have gotten ready for work.  He also snoops around the kitchen and doesn't respond to commands, so that was a struggle. Now I'm feeding him in the crate and keeping him out of the kitchen till commands are solid.

Pre-dog life, I woke up at 5 and left for work around 630/7. That time was filled with chores/self-care/paperwork/showering/getting dressed/sometimes running if I'm up at 4.

With dog, I'm getting up at 4 and not accomplishing ANYTHING because our routine is still a WIP.  I can't get dressed/pee, etc. because I'm trying to make sure he's safe/occupied.

After work, I need at least 10-30 minutes to decompress from the day, set things down, put away my lunch, etc.etc. etc. Today I actually had a phone appointment, and he whined 2x when I came in, but was fine until I got off of the phone. (was upstairs but sound is like we're in the same room).

I like to feed him around 5pm for dinner even though I get home between 3 and 4. EVERYTIME he comes out of the crate he thinks it's time to eat but hopefully he will figure out it's not. 

Again, I feel like a jerk for not letting him out as soon as I get home. But, for my mental health and feeling organized, I cannot right now. As soon as he's out, I cannot do anything but pay attention to him, and that includes eating, just playing around on my phone, watching tv/reading. 

We live on the 2nd floor in an urban environment, so I can't just let him outside to do his business. I have to feed him first, then suit up to go outside. (Harness for him, coat/shoes/keys/fanny pack with treats and poop bags for me). He takes forever to put the harness on because he is a wiggle worm, so going out twice in the morning is extremely time consuming.

I \*need\* to be consistent  for him (and myself) ASAP, so I just want to know if it's okay to let him hang out in the crate for just a little longer, so I can be fully put together and can give him my full attention.",0,1575926129

DogCare,e5jkdy,venturousviajera,1,Insurance Question/pre-existing conditions and upcoming vet visit,"I adopted a dog a month ago. The shelter includes a month of free insurance from 24pethealth, and a 2 week care package from VCA Animal Hospitals. I was able to take my dog to VCA for a regular check up, which was covered including some preventatives. He was positive for Giardia, so we did have to go back and unfortunately do 2 courses of antibiotics. The first fill was covered, as part of the 2 week plan/ but the refill I paid for out of pocket. 24pethealth did not accept my claim because it was a ""pre-existing condition"". 

Fortunately, that has cleared up, but the VCA is about a 35 min drive, and my dog has EXTREME anxiety in the car and poops every time. We're working on it.

For now, there are some other things I'd like to get checked out with him, and establish care at a local vet. He has some behavioral/anxiety issues, skin issues, and I need some guidance on his diet since he was recovering from giardia, and the previous vet recommended a certain diet until he gains weight but I can't get him on my scale, haha, and I would like professional guidance for his dietary needs. s

My trial with 24pethealth ends this week, but I'm fairly certain they do not cover regular visits. I'd like to sign up with a different company based on reviews/research and my general experience with them. (Their microchipping stuff seems scammy, but that's the company the shelter uses for it). 

\*\*If I sign up with a new company, would anything that the vet finds tomorrow be considered a pre-existing condition? I could sign up now, but honestly I do not want to wait to go to the vet.

DogCare,e59zhm,AntiquePen,1,[Help] Dog owning anxiety.,"I've had my good boy since June. I love him to bits and pieces and I want what's best for him. Unfortunately most days I have no idea what best for him is.

My current guess is that he's a Boingle (German Shorthaired Pointer and Beagle mix). When he got here he was scared of everything. He's gotten comfortable with my partner and I, but the rest of the world is still scary.

We try to walk him twice a day, however when leaves fell he got scared again. I think it was the noise. We usually have to carry him a few feet or he'll dash back to the house, even if tempted by treats. I'm not sure if we're reinforcing bad habits and being cruel, or if not walking him and letting him tear through the house when he has too much energy would be cruel.

I worry about food and his weight. His breed is said to eat everything they see even when they aren't hungry. He's gained weight since we've gotten him but he's also grown. I'm worried were overfeeding him (we do wet and dry, so we estimate what both packages recommend).

I feel like I can't keep the house safe enough for him. I swear, he always finds a way to steal socks or loose papers no matter how high out of reach I put them. I worry that I'm giving him too much attention and that I'm neglecting him.

Is there ever a point where an owner feels like they're doing more good than bad for their dog?",5,1575339676

I have a staffy x (rescue) and as spring has rolled around here in Australia she has developed a rash on her hind legs - I suspect it's an allergic reaction to grass.  It keeps her awake at night and looks very itchy!

My partner and I will be taking her to the vet for some antibiotic cream etc., but I remember a friend of mine had a staffy and they were constantly spending a lot of money on all kinds of treatments for her skin.  For this reason I'd like to find some natural solutions to ease its itchiness as well, because being on antibiotics etc. for three months of a year sounds less than ideal!

Also, I hope this doesn't make it sound as though I am against medication.  I am totally for it and she will be provided with whatever she needs.  It's just that since this is likely to be a chronic condition, I'd love to treat it in as many ways as possible to keep her inflammation to a minimum.

DogCare,dvv7g1,RustyCorners,1,Vaginal Discharge Post Spay,"I adopted a rescue dog from a local shelter last Wednesday.  She had her spay surgery that same day.  She is an approximately 3 year old catahoula cur who seems otherwise healthy, just over 47 pounds. 

When coming home from her surgery she was still spotting a bit of blood which I was assured as normal.  As the days have gone on the discharge has changed from bloody bright red, too mauve and cloudy, to now a greenish/yellow discharge with a little bit of texture/chunks if I wipe her vagina with a paper towel when I notice it leaking out.  The most recent just happened now after we were playing a bit, she walked away and I could see discharge so I wiped it.  

She saw a very busy vet on Monday who said things looked normal but didn't do a deep exam.  I've only had her since Wednesday, so I can't speak to how ""normal"" her behavior is.  She doesn't drink much water, maybe once or twice a day.  She goes out to walk/exercise 3 times a day, early morning, midday, and again before bed.  She pees every time she goes out.  This morning she did her normal pee when off leash in the dog park and then peed twice more a little on her walk.  This was a new pattern over the past week.  

Her appetite is normal, she's eating 1.5 cups of dry high quality kibble twice daily, in the morning after her walk and then around dinner time between the two afternoon/evening walks.  After the first couple days her bowel movements have been a seemingly normal size and texture. 

I haven't cared for a recently spayed female since I was a child, so I have no history to lean on here and I am concerned if I should push harder on the vet and bring her back, or should I wait another week for when her cone comes off, two weeks out from her surgery and see if it improves?",2,1573666808

DogCare,duep1e,NationHood,1,Anyone else experience a dog limp out of nowhere?,"Background: he just turned 4 years old on Halloween, is 50% German Shepherd, 25% Pitbull, and 25% Shar Pei. Healthy, never had any noticeable health issues in his entire life with me. Been with me since he was about 3-5 weeks old.

Yesterday morning, I woke up and went outside to see my dog walking towards me with a noticeable limp on his right front paw.

I checked his paw and leg out and looked for possible cuts or splinters or anything that could be bothering him but couldn't find anything. I moved his leg slightly back and forth and couldn't tell where this could be coming from.

While sitting, he would sometimes pick his paw up and even let me grab it and hold onto it or even rest it on my leg. He will sometimes let me do that, but usually will pull back after a short while and doesn't seem to have a ""smile"" on his face while I'm holding his paw. While I held it yesterday, he let me hold onto it for a lot longer than usual and had that ""smile"" across his face. Basically, he seemed to be in a good mood and better than previous times.

I took him to the vet and he continued to limp until the vet came to check him out. He became slightly aggressive towards the vet and vet assistant once they had taken the leash from me and it was around this time his limp started to not be as noticeable.

They took him to the back and left me in the exam room as they were going to put a muzzle on him and check him out a little more closely. The vet came back and said that his limp doesn't seem to be there anymore. Additionally, he couldn't tell where a pain could be. He had tested the paw and leg much like I did, from the way he was describing to me, trying to get my dog to yip in pain but couldn't. He said they could usually pinpoint the area of pain and then X-ray, but they couldn't exactly X-ray this because it's too large of an area.

The vet did give him an inflammatory injection, because...I honestly can't remember the reason he gave me, but it seemed reasonable at the time.

We left the vet and while walking out of the door, my dog no longer had a limp in his step. When getting back home, the limp was gone until he began running, where it was slightly noticeable, but not like earlier.

Now, I don't see a limp at all, even when running.

I noticed this at around 10 a.m. yesterday morning and we didn't get the vet to check him out until 2:20 p.m. and we left the vet around 2:50 p.m. and arrived back home around 3:00 p.m.

DogCare,dsbngj,TheRealWhiskers,16,"Found a ""stray"" dog, am I doing the right thing for his well-being?","So this all started yesterday afternoon when I was leaving work.. we have a large parking lot and as our shift ended hundreds of people were leaving. Several of us spotted a terrified dog with his tail tucked darting between and underneath vehicles. Another employee said he had seen the dog in the parking lot early that morning, so he had been there all day at least. Being the softies that a couple of us are, we tried to corral him in and he ended up underneath a pickup truck that wasn't leaving. He was very scared, shaking like a leaf, and we were struggling to get him to come out as he wasn't interested in food. One guy called animal control and in the mean time we tried encouraging him to come out and found that he was not aggressive at all when touched. Eventually animal control showed up and was able to catch him with the pole and gently slide him out. They scanned him for a chip and were not able to detect one. He is quite thin with his full rib cage visible through his fur and you can feel his spine and hip bones very clearly protruding. Other than that he appears to be in good health, his fur was dirty and smelled strongly as if he had been laying in his own urine, but otherwise is in good condition. He had no identification, has not been neutered, and is clearly malnourished. He doesn't appear to be in any pain either. Is it safe to assume at this point that he is a 'stray' to some degree or had possibly been dumped in the area? I checked multiple lost and found pet registries and facebook pages in the area but found nothing.  


Anyhow, because he was so docile the animal control people told us that if any of us were interested we were welcome to take him home so that they would not have to take him to the shelter. At this point I had already convinced myself that I want him so it wasn't long before he was home in my kitchen. He was still terrified and shaking, but had let everyone so far handle him, pick him up, pet him, etc. without showing any sign of aggression at all. It's been about 30 hours since we found him and I have not heard him growl or bark once yet, only whimper a bit during the night last night. A friend brought over a large kennel that I set up with a blanket to lay on and a blanket covering all but one end of the exterior so it's like an enclosed safe box for him. After about 5 hours he began eating dry and wet food and drinking water without any troubles and has gone to the bathroom (on my carpet) a couple of times. He let me put a collar on him without fussing at all, but if I put a leash on and try to take him outside he lays down, freezes up and won't move. He did let me carry him into my shower and bathe him as well. I was able to soap him up with canine shampoo, rub all over and rinse him without any fuss from him at all. He just seems completely submissive when anyone handles him. I feel so sorry for him, he is just the sweetest, most timid dog I have ever seen. He even just lays there and watches my two cats as they approach and check him out. Coincidentally I already had a vet appointment scheduled for tomorrow for my cats to get their yearly exams, so I called and asked if they could accommodate a 3rd animal during the visit so he will be coming along for a checkup.  


I guess long story short, am I getting too attached to this little guy when I should be actively trying to find out if he has an owner? I feel guilty like I'm snatching him up from someone else, but at the same time being lost with no I.D., un-neutered and malnourished/filthy tells me he wasn't being taken care of for some time anyways if he had been someone's pet at one time.",16,1573017209

I've had him since I was 12 years old and he was a little pup. He is 9 now and slowly starting to get old (his back makes problems from time to time). I can't find anybody who takes care of him while we are gone. When we are on vacation he lives with my parents, about 8 hours away from our place.

We adopted her off a hunter who had no use for her anymore as she is fearful, she warmed up to us but she would sit in the corner of our bed 20 hours a day and be anxious because we had roommates, at this time she was fine going for walks, the neighbourhood wasnt great but we werent on a main road so it was quiet and she loved being out of the house.


Now that we've moved into a larger apartment shes very happy inside, she runs around and plays indoors though she gets upset and paces at any noises outside, weird shadows or general differences in enviroment and shes terrified of strangers


The problem is on walks shes an absolute mess, if theres ANY noises more than a dull hush shes panicked, moderate winds, doors closing, people chatting, etc. She goes into a belly on the ground army crawl to try to drag me inside as quickly and aggressively as possible. We started with 15 minute walks around the apartments and now its down to: we walk out one door, she either pees first or hears something and yanks full force towards the front door inside. We can hardly go 20 feet.


She isnt food driven shes completely fear driven when outside and my boyfriend doesnt want to push her too far because in the first few months of us having her she freaked out and slipped her harness and was lost for 4 days, if she really tried and got out where we are now we think shed be dead within the hour. We're looking into cbd oil and other anxiety reducing alternatives but the vet says shes perfectly healthy shes just very scared of outside.


Does anyone have any input or ideas that can help me, please try not to shame me too hard about keeping a farm dog in an apartment we know its not ideal but we keep her well exercised and we are very patient with her and I feel we've built up too much trust we couldnt think of watching someone who doesnt know all her ticks take her and her feeling abandoned again",1,1572369766

We took her from a family friend who did not know how to take care of a dog. She arrived in our home when she was only about 3 or 4 months old. She's extremely smart, incredibly stubborn and loves and trust people almost to a fault.  


About a year ago her breath started to stink really badly and her teeth got bad. Not all, about 30-40%. Two have even fallen out. I now believe that she has periodontal disease or gingivitis. We live in a country where veterinary clinics are specialized for farm animals and there are no real veterinarian specialized in dog care that can truly help with this.  


About a week ago I started giving her clindamycin (for humans) out of pure desperation because I was afraid if I did not do something infection could start effecting her other organs. She did not have any side effects and to my surprise her breath stopped smelling. She even became more active (which I was shocked by because she is already pretty active dog to begin with).   


I've read up the best I could on the internet about it and it's mostly used in combination with surgery. I don't know if/when to stop giving it to her now. It is helping her, that I can see. But I don't know if I'm only delaying the inevitable or actually helping.",0,1571786851

I've checked the other posts about this issue and there are surprisingly a lot of people who are dealing with the same problem we are. 

Vet has ruled out cancer, neurologic issue, stones, and anything else that might cause constant UTIs. They give us two weeks of amoxicilian each time and it doesn't work. We've even done UAs during antibiotic rounds to make sure that the normals are going down and they do, only to go back up after meds end. We've also done 3 cultures (all say e. Coli). 

After the first round of antibiotics he declined so rapidly the days after he had an ""event"" that we are unsure if it was a seizure/cardiac/stroke and we found him with pee everywhere and unable to walk well and kept circling, but he made a full recovery and hasn't had an issue like that sense. However, because of this we always fear when another round of antibiotics ends. He has started his 4th round yesterday 3 days after coming off the last round and starting up with the same old symptons (constant need to pee, uncomfortable, not wanting to eat).

DogCare,dhszkf,Contain94,2,"Thinking about getting a support dog for my best friend, but no idea how much this would cost me long term","Hey guys,  


I'll try to summarize the story here. My best friend lives in New York, I live in Canada (although I'm originally from France), and we've been close friends for 4 years now. I see her from time to time, we both value our friendship very much. Anyway, she struggles in life. She recently had to leave her job, she got evicted from her apartment for no reason and now has to go back to her family until she figures shit out. She's 3000 dollars in debt with bad health insurance that makes her pay ridiculous money for the medication she needs. She has chemical and seasonal depression, so she's mainly on Prozac and other stuff I don't remember. When the winter comes she's basically fighting not to harm or kill herself, and she has a very hard time finding a purpose. Life has been incredibly unfair to her, as she's the sweetest soul I know and such a hard worker, and I want to do something for her to feel better.  
So the thing is, she loves dogs. Like a lot. It's her thing, when a dog comes in the room, she just brightens up and it gives her so much comfort. She's so good with them. And so we've been talking about her getting a dog. She would love to, and I'm certain that it would make her life so much easier to live. But because of her situation, she can't afford it.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with Mast Cell Tumors and could provide some insight.  
I have an 8 year old female hound mix. She gets skin tags occasionally. I‚Äôve had a few removed from her while she was under anesthesia during routine dental cleanings. A couple of months ago, I noticed another skin tag looking bump on her. It was located on the right side of her chest. It definitely appeared and grew suddenly. However, once it reached a certain size (was maybe the size of an eraser on a pencil), it stopped growing. I left it alone, assuming it was a skin tag, and figured I would have the vet look at it during her check up and annual dental cleaning (which was today).  
  
During her dental cleaning, the vet called me telling me that he recommended removing it and sending it to pathology since it looked ulcerated. He also told me that it was a growth and definitely not a skin tag. He told me that if it was anything, he would think it would be a Mast Cell Tumor. He said not to worry about anything until the pathology results came back. But, of course I‚Äôm worrying! My dog has been acting totally fine. Her recent routine blood work also came back normal.

* My dog is a 1 year old rescue hound mix that I adopted \~ a month ago
* He *loves* to run.  He loves chasing and being chased.  
* When we first get to the park, he acts a bit timid and runs away from other dogs, sticking to the fence.  But after a few minutes, he warms up and the tail is up and wagging the whole time.  He sticks with the main group of dogs as well.

So about 30 minutes into our dog park visit today, my dog and another dog ran head first at full speeds.  Mine got a little airborne and did an awkward half flip.  Right after, he isolated himself and acted *terrified* of any dog (not just the dog that ran into him) within 10 feet of him.  He ran over to me and sat down under the bench, which he's never done before.  I'm chalking it up to the run in scaring him and that next visit he'll be a-okay, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone has something to say about our situation.

We tried doing this but now she‚Äôs just itching constantly. Biting her paws and legs, scratching her face and chest, licking her genitals. Being detracted by walks, playtime and food helps but when she‚Äôs just around the house, or at night she itches almost constantly. We‚Äôve tried cutting almost everything she eats out and reintroducing it to see if we can work it out but to no avail and I‚Äôm starting to think it could be something around her like pollen or dust? 
So far I found that a nice cool bath with no products cools her skin down a little bit and helps her go to sleep and when she gets really bad I put an antihistamine in her food as per my vets advice. 
I was wondering if anyone has an ideas on how I determine what my dog is actually allergic to so I can keep her away from it? Baring in mind I‚Äôve noticed no pattern in her itching, after she comes in from outside, goes to a particular house, eats something or otherwise.

DogCare,d6z9lp,dead_kennedy,14,Next door neighbor's dog left outside for extended periods of time and is showing signs of anxiety.," I'm hoping this post fits into the topics of r/DogCare. I thought this was a good community to ask for advice on this topic.

We recently moved into a new house and the next door neighbors leave their dog outside for long periods of time. We have noticed that she is outside for up to 12 (maybe even more) hours at a time. Not only does it break our hearts to hear her barking and whining, but our dog is upset about it too. She whines at the window in a sort of sympathy whine.

She is left outside in a dog run that we estimate is about 100 square feet. The area is partially covered and she has a dog house available. I can‚Äôt say for sure, but I can‚Äôt see a water or food bowl (she could absolutely have ones that I can‚Äôt see from my property. She barks, whines, claws at the fencing and is panting constantly. I know these are all signs of anxiety and I am at a loss as to what to do.

We don‚Äôt want to ruin a relationship with our neighbors, but this needs to stop. It is also a violation of the King County nuisance codes. We are looking for advice on how to approach the neighbors before we contact the county. We have met one of them once and she mentioned that the dog was left outside so she didn‚Äôt jump on the couch while they are away at work. I also need to add that they work under a mile from the house. It has not yet hit a temperature that is low enough for the dog to be hypothermic, but we‚Äôre in a Seattle suburb and today the high will be 61 degrees. It was in the 50‚Äôs when they left for work. I also know what time they leave for work as I leave the house at the same time which makes it easy to estimate the time she is left alone.

As a long time animal lover and a former farm girl, this is just not okay in my book. We were thinking of offering to walk the dog as much as our schedules allow or recommending a family member that has a dog walking business. Having the dog over to play with ours is not an option as our dog is protective of the property and has really only found one other dog that she puts up with. She has been socialized but it didn‚Äôt seem to help. I think they could walk together as long as the other dog doesn‚Äôt get in her space too often. Our dog just a turd.  

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",9,1569005105

DogCare,d2qtlh,MetalNutSack,4,Question about my pups peeling paws,"I adopted a 1 year old rescue a couple days ago, and have been taking him to the park twice a day and he‚Äôs been absolutely loving it.  However, after getting back yesterday, I noticed a limp.  I was worried it was a pulled muscle or the likes, but then I noticed dead skin peeling from under his front paws.  My best guess is that he‚Äôs never been able to run so much, so his paws aren‚Äôt used to the high-impact, constant friction.  Similar to humans where if you haven‚Äôt done any hand work in a long time, you‚Äôll get some blisters.  

I have a vet apt. scheduled this Monday for the usual recent adoption check up (kennel cough, etc.).  I mentioned the paws, and they said they‚Äôd take a look.

Am I able to still take him to the park in the meantime, or will it just make his condition worse?  He acts eager to go, and since he‚Äôs only 1 I really need to let him exercise.",6,1568211262

She now has renal failure, bladder failure, hypertension, and incontinence. She is ornery and bites me and my boyfriend (of almost 10 years so shes been with him longer than without him) but my vet keeps telling me it's not time. I've spent over 6k since 12.8.18 and I don't see her costs slowing down. That includes her vet visits, hospital stays, prescription food, diapers, potty pads, etc. She bites me now and she never ever bit me before then last 6 months. She was feral so I have always groomed her myself but she won't even let me near her with scissors anymore and if she knows I'm getting ready to leave for work and I even look at her she literally attacks me. She urinates in her sleep so she has to be diapered even though we walk her at 9:30p, 1:30a, 4:30a, and 7a before we leave for work. We lock her in the livingroom/ kitchen with potty pads, her food, water, the couch and her toys, etc. But she still pees in her sleep ON THE COUCH so at least once a week, if not 3-4 nights a week I have to wash our couch covers because she has urinated on them. 

I keep asking my vet is it time to put her down but the vet keeps saying no and she will tell me when it's time. I think I give her enough love and care and pay careful attention to her diet etc so her ""numbers"" (besides her high phosphorus levels) are ""better than ever"" according to the vet. I've taken her for one other opinion and that vet wanted me to test her for Addison's Disease, which when reading online sounded CRAZY expensive, time consuming and inconclusive. And if she has it, what, I treat my 12-14 year old dog for this crazy disease?

I've never spent more than 1500 at once so I don't think a 500 dollar invoice is worth declining treatment if it helps but I'm so lost and feel like I'm keeping her alive for me, but my vets keep saying she's doing ok! 

How do you know when it's time? She's my first pet and my best friend. Been with me since I was 18 and has been the only constant since.

DogCare,ctb459,secretlydickish,1,Raw food hygiene and training issues with friend's puppy,"Long time lurker, but I am at my wits end, so I made a reddit account and a bunch of other forum accounts looking for advice.

I have (had?) a good friend who has a Bernese Mountain puppy named Elise. Elise is my friend's first dog, and she's almost 1 year old now, very fluffy, and getting huge. She's super friendly, but my main issue (which may be friendship breaking) is how the owner looks after her and trains her.

All our friends come to my place often because I'm in the downtown core and easily accessible. I have a pet-friendly apartment suite (3 bed, 2 bath, so a decent sized place).

Elise is now starting a raw food diet. Whatever my friend wants to feed her dog is not my issue, or so I thought. Elise is a huge drooler and licker, and she's been eating raw turkey bones on my hardwood floor, playing with her meat patties on my kitchen tiles, licking people's faces and my furniture. It is okay for me to not be okay with this? I am aware of the appeal some people have for raw food diets, but for me, the cleanliness of my house also means a lot.

There are some of the more fundamental issues, which haven't resulted in much yet, but I can see the incoming disaster. Elise jumps on my couch and bed without permission from me or the owner, ignores warning signs from other dogs who want more personal space (when other friends bring dogs over, lots of growling occurs. Some friends leave their dogs at home now because of it), has attempted counter surfing, and is a heavy resource guarder (of her bones and toys). My friend brings Elise every time we hang out because she can't be left alone by herself at home (since she's still a puppy).

My friend is a close friend in the group, but I don't get how she doesn't see the issues. I mentioned not letting Elise back to my place, and she's mad now, saying Elise will outgrow these behaviors once she gets out of her puppy stage. I disagree. The only issues I have with this friend are currently with her dog. So my questions are:

1. Should I be concerned about the raw food and drool combo, or am I being a stick-in-the-mud about hygiene?
2. Can I do anything to assist with the training if I let the dog back to my house?
3. Is it mean for me to not let Elise back into my home? Do I just not understand puppies enough?",0,1566357984

We recently took her to the vet to get a second round of Praziquantel injected for a tapeworm she had. It‚Äôs been about a week since the injection, and yesterday she started whining out of nowhere.

We took him in and he was doing good, eating well, and going potty regularly but around noon the next day he got really lethargic and we kind of panicked because we also noticed a hernia on his belly and we're afraid that something was really wrong. We took him to the vet, and turns out there's nothing wrong and he's likely had the hernia since birth. They estimated that he is about 7 or 8 months old, border collie and Australian Shepherd mix. That's just their best guess. As far as I know those are too high energy dogs, but he's very relaxed and takes multiple naps every day. Is there a reason for this? Is it because he is still young or will his temperment stay the same? I'm sure it's probably different from dog to dog, but what do you all think?",0,1565644862

DogCare,couffp,twelfth_pluto,9,"First time caring for a dog, but she's acting out. I need help!","So, I'm currently housesitting for a family with a dog for around a month. The dog is pretty old, and she doesnt play much anymore, she just eats, sleeps, and walks. I am meant to feed and walk her 3 times a day around breakfast, lunch, and dinner time.  

However, I'm having some issues. For one, I work a physical night shift job, so I need to sleep during the day. I've been trying to keep her schedule as normal as possible, I tried out walking her and promptly sleeping when I get off work around 8am, waking up at lunchtime to walk her, going back to sleep, and waking up again at 6pm to walk her before making myself a meal and going to work, but that resulted in very, very bad sleep for me and I was seriously struggling at work. 
So then I thought I would walk her when I get home, stay up until lunchtime to walk her again, and then sleep until 8:30pm at which time I would walk her and head to work. This works much better for my sleep needs. However, she has been....acting up, it seems. 

She has now pooped three times inside the house (and the owners said that very rarely happens), and she ripped apart a trash bag in a trash can and ate used tampons in it. They warned me about her trying to steal food off of table but she has gone out of her way to take food and even jumped up and bit into a sandwich on a plate while I was holding the plate. 

I would translate these actions as her being dissatisfied or bored, only...I dont know how to do any better. I spend ALL my time during the week working, sleeping, and walking her, I have almost no time to spare to make her life better, let alone my own. But it's incredibly frustrating to come home to poop on a carpet or tampons on the floor and take time I dont have to clean it up. On top of that, when she does do something wrong (like eat my sandwich) I have no idea how to discipline her so that she'll understand.

Confession time: I've never looked after dogs before this and used to be really afraid of them. I'm a lot better now, but I still don't really like dogs. I do everything I can to be nice to her, give treats when she's good, pat her and talk to her, let her take her time on her walks...but it feels like she's acting out like an angsty teenager anyways. I've owned and looked after many other animals and not ever had issues. Is she just sensing my emotional distance from her and acting on that, or is she understimulated, or both? Or something else? I'm willing to take any suggestions at this point.",3,1565512694

We live in Florida right now and ever since we moved here every summer has gotten harder and harder on her with the constant storms. She has actually started shaking all the time now and not just when it's raining. The sound of the shower sets her off too. Strangely enough she sometimes wants to go out into the rain. And she always comes into the shower with me now because I've given up on keeping her out because it's so hard to see her scared.
 I asked her usual vet for advice last summer and he prescribed her zanex... I've never heard of anything so crazy. I've given it to her a few times because she shakes so violently I worry about her. But I don't think it's healthy in the long run. 
She has actually started hiding behind my washer and dryer. I resisted it at first but it seems to be the one place she feels safe, so I put a couple blankets back there for her now. I have a thunder shirt for her and it seems to help when she wears it. But she's lost all interest in playing and sometimes won't even eat and I worry.


Tldr is there anything more I can do for her. I can't imagine that its a fun way to live for her and I need see advice?

DogCare,clc6gf,NewMePls,6,"Old dog and arthritis, very sudden? What to do?","My parents took their 12-year-old dog to the vet today after a rough 3 days. The vet told them the dog has **severe arthritis of the back legs and back; and to prepare themselves to put her down** anywhere from the next few weeks up to a year. Obviously they were devastated and so am I. 

We were blindsided because - yes as I said, the past few 3 days were tough HOWEVER - **she normally acts like a puppy still**. I was just over at their house two weeks ago and their dog was zooming around the yard, jumping around, playing fetch, and generally really happy. She has always been that way and people are always amazed to hear her age because of the amount of energy she has. 

My parents said in the past few months, she had been having **a little trouble getting up and down** tall chairs and such. But she never expressed any type of pain, she still got up and down on smaller things fine, she still had a very healthy appetite, she was still walking/running/jumping/playing/etc just fine (even going up and down stairs). There has been no limping or extra tiredness, **she's been the same as she always has been**. 

**Except for these past 3 days**. On Tuesday, she started having trouble sitting + laying down and would groan loudly every time she did so. Same thing for getting back up. I visited on Wednesday and it was sad to see. I thought honestly maybe she had somehow sprained one of her legs or something. Yesterday my parents said she started falling anytime she tried to run so they are discouraging her from doing so. They told me it broke their heart to see that because she would groan/scream extremely loudly when it happened. 

And now today, at the vet for him to say that she is only going to get worse. Can this possibly be true? How could she go from being totally normal and happy to being so debilitated within such a tiny span of time? I guess I am trying to wrap my head around this. **Is this normal? For it to happen this fast?** The vet gave them two pills their dog is suppose to take every day - one for pain management, another for anti-inflammatory - and this is suppose to help her feel + do better in the short term but he said there is nothing that can be done for the long term, and prepare to put her down sometime within the next year. Is this true? **Does this sound legitimate?**

I don't mean to be disrespectful towards the vet at all. I genuinely don't know about this stuff and I am just gobsmacked and heartbroken, so I'm trying to understand and it would be nice to hear from other dog owners if you've had this experience. Thank you for your time.",16,1564791669

DogCare,cj67i4,KewkZ,8,My dog is noticeably and progressively changing,"TLDR: My dog has changed since I got her spayed and left her with my mom for 2 weeks. She's barking at people and dogs, food aggression has changed, and she's aggressively chasing her tail.  


My Chihuahua is \~1.5yrs old. She was abandon at a guesstimated 6 weeks old and kept for another 2 weeks. At an estimated 8 weeks I adopted her. 

She has always had pretty bad separation anxiety, believed to be caused by  abandonment. Nothing too wild, she just hates to be alone or confined. She always showers with me and I assumed this is her anxiety from the thought of being alone. She's not loud anymore but for a long time she hated when I would go to work. She is pretty used to it now, though.   


She has severe food aggression when it comes to human food. She actually bit me and when I recoiled it tore my finger up and I bled pretty badly. She's always been a very sweet loving dog so that was a shocker. When I give her bones from my steak or ribs she will try to kill me when I get near her. I've never taken food from her, not once. I tried to bring her food while she was already eating to show her everything was ok. I've just sat next to her while she growled at me to show her I would not take her food.   


The food problem was severe about 6 months ago and now its better in that she doesn't try to kill me but it's worse in that she will growl at me while in my arms 10-15min after she stopped eating her bone. I can somewhat calm her down, it feels like she has this demon inside of her but when I caress her jaw /neck area she fights the demon off and little by little it goes away, just not fully. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's never really cared about humans. She's not the typical bark at everyone Chihuahua. I take her to park events with 500-1000 people and she just follows me around, off leash. She's never really just walked up to people and hung out, unless they have food of course. She's never barked at dogs as well. She's always been very playful with them.   


Now, with people she's been very weird. She's started barking at people around my neighborhood, on leash which is new. She doesn't really bark at dogs on leash but I had her in my arms outside and she was trying to get out of my arms very aggressively and barking with anger at a much bigger dog. Usually she just runs around them and plays.   


This month she started chasing her tail and I really didn't think too much about it. Then she started doing it in bed, waking us up. Normally she sleeps until I we wake up. She's always been very good to not get up if we're sleeping. Some times her pitch and tone will change where I can hear anger. She'll chase her tail so aggressively that she will hit her head on something from not paying attention. She'll tumble in bed for the same reason. The other day she would go berserk nearly every time I would get up from my computer. She would chase her tail on the low end of aggression.  


Perhaps relevant additional info, I got her spayed about 8 weeks ago. I had her for a week and left for Thailand for 2 weeks. While I was in Thailand she was with my mom. All new/changed behavior is post Thailand. I can say with out a doubt she is a different dog now.",8,1564373832

DogCare,chefuj,whobulbabble,2,How to address people feeding my dogs?,"TLDR at the bottom

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this question this may be better suited to something like 
r/peopletraining. I really need some advice about how to address this issue as I am starting to consider rehoming my dogs.

I have two Catahoula leopard dogs one is about 12 years and the other is just over a year. They are great and mean the world to me. Well behaved, great companions who I love very much. Both dogs are well trained and very intelligent.  

Here is the issue. For some reason everyone who comes into contact with my dogs finds it necessary to try and feed them whatever may be available at the time. This can range from dog treats to all types of ""people food"" (I once left my dog alone with a family member for a moment to step inside my house, only to return and find them feeding the dogs a glass of Kahlua and milk, WTF!) This ranges across nearly all visitors at my home and most people we come across in public (I could share many stories). 

The 12 year old has a fairly strong stomach and can usually get by. The pup however, is not as lucky, following the Kahlua incident I spent about 1 month getting his stomach back on schedule. This included meds, and dealing with accidents at night and throughout the day in his crate. 

I have asked and begged family members and guests please do not feed my dogs. To no avail. I have asked my wife repeatedly not to feed the dogs anything but their designated dog food, yet she continues to feed them whatever she has in her hand. 

When the dogs go any amount of time only eating their dry dog foods, they do great, no accidents, solid poo, etc. 

On the other hand anything but dog food results in multiple daily accidents and many sleepless nights. 

What is it that drives people to feed others dogs? Who does this? Why? And why would one continue to do this knowing it makes the dog sick? 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

Like I said I am at a loss as to what to do. I am worried that either I am going to snap and hurt someone for hurting them or I am just going to get rid of the dogs altogether.

Our pup will be outfitted with his own inner tube and life jacket. We are thinking of securing him to my inner tube/life jacket with a tether/rope of some kind, if he's not on my lap (he is 8 lbs, mini aussie, currently 22 weeks). 

We are in the Pacific northwest, and by the time we go, he will have had 12 days after his second/last round of lepto shots.

My dog threw up and is acting like his usual self. He woke up around 6:00, peed and we ran around the yard. Afterward he had breakfast (dry kibble) and we play a bit with his toys, usually one more potty trip. Sometime between 9:00 am to 1:00 pm he take a long nap on the couch with some interruptions to remind the squirrels who's boss and let the big trucks know he's protecting his domain, he did so today. We went out about 10:30 and I didn't notice anything unusual. He peed, then tried to bark at some men working across the street so I made him come in. 

Around noon I went to the living room to find that he threw up. It was just kibble and some grass, I didn't see any foreign objects, no blood, no mucus, no bile. It didn't even have much of a smell or any liquid. Around this time he usually moves nap to where I am and is a bit playful, which he's doing now. My partner came home for lunch and he did his usual greeting routine of loudly barking. When I went outside to throw the vomit away, he greeted me by rearing up on his back paws and trying to hug me. His belly isn't bloated and he didn't object to me touching it. Before I saw the vomit I had him sit in return for a treat, he did and ate it.

So my question is, now what? He's being his usual self. He'll have rice and canned pumpkin for dinner. Taking his water bowl away seems unnecessary since he's acting normal. I have him in here with me while the enzyme solution works on the floor. Is there anything else I should be doing? Are there any red flags I could be missing?",3,1563986637

DogCare,cedxbm,2dogproblems,1,Struggling with second dog and unsure what to do,"My husband and I adopted a second dog a week ago and, while there are no MAJOR problems, we're struggling to know whether it was the best move for either dog and what to do about it. This is somewhat long, but I'm trying to include all of the important info to get the best advice.

We've had our first dog for about 2.5 years; she's around 6 years old, a total mixed breed dog (shepherd like fur but small), around 50 pounds. She's been completely house trained since we got her and we have never crated her at home. She's a total sweetheart, but not perfect, with her major issues being that she's leash reactive, never really knew how to play (generally just barks as loud as she can at other dogs), and doesn't like children (we don't have any but have nieces and nephews). She has generally done fairly well with male dogs that are her size or bigger but is very dominant, has to be the alpha, and she's anxious about her sharing her spaces/things. So, we knew we'd have an adjustment period.

The second dog that we adopted is around 5 years old, also a mixed breed (husky like fur but small), and around 55 lbs. He had never had a home before, so we knew that he would take a lot of adjustment time, but the shelter was hopeful that our first dog would teach him how to live in a home. When they first met, he was very submissive to her and preferred to keep her distance.

The second dog is new to a home, so is crated when we leave, and you can't let him wander the house or he'll destroy things, but that all seems normal and like we could adjust to it. We're worried about their interactions. He started out terrified of our first dog; she would lay in the living room and growl when he approached, so he'd stay in the dining room or in his crate instead of interacting. We were optimistic when he got over that AND they were playing a lot together, but now he's gotten WAY over his nervousness. He intentionally presses ALL of her buttons. He'll walk over and take toys that she's cuddling with, she'll be laying on the floor dozing and he'll go and stand over the top of her or even lay on top of her, she'll try to walk away from him and he continues to pester her. She seems exhausted and is getting increasingly aggressive in her responses. It's hard to stop him because he's not well trained yet so won't come when we call or lay and settle when we try to get him too. We break them up and he just keeps going back to restart it.

Our concern is that, as his personality comes out more, they both need to be the dominant dog and that won't end well. We're just not sure that we're the best home for him or that adding him to our family was fair to our first dog. Thoughts? Advice? Will this just work itself out over time or are there ways to better facilitate it instead of finding him a new home?",0,1563375366

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of a story to start. We adopted a puppy last winter. She was advertised as an English Bulldog mix (which is what caught our eye) and we hurriedly rushed to meet her and start the process. She was tiny and didn't really resemble a bulldog, but we figured since we don't know what she's mixed with and she's small, maybe she'll grow into it. Turns out I think they labeled her as bulldog mix to attract fools like us who really want a bulldog but can't afford several thousand dollars. So now months later, we're pretty sure shes mostly greyhound. She has the shape, the energy, and the speed. We initially fed her by the instructions on the puppy food bag. But she acted starved all the time. Greyhound sites said that this breed of dog eats more food and more regularly. So I bumped up the serving size and frequency but she STILL acts hungry all the time and she takes MASSIVE dumps, and she takes them 5 - 10 times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions ...  Is this normal? Am I feeding her too much?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since we got her in the winter, we mat trained her. We figured it would be an easy switch to get her to go outside once the weather was nice. Wrong. This dog will go out for hours, she'll run and play the whole time. But she won't pee or poop ever. As soon as we get inside she heads towards the mat and lets it fly. On top of that, she seems to have somehow gotten ""untrained"" when it comes to using the mat. She'll get close, but rarely on the damn thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on these other issues?

I have a dog and her name is Charlie. She's 15. Recently she's been falling a lot and her legs give in. She gets scared when she's alone at night and cries.  We solved this by having her come up stairs where everyone sleeps. Charlie can use the stairs but must always have someone with her to get her started or else she'll just sit there and cry. We got another dog, Nymeria,  around 2 years ago and before that Charlie only laid on the floor all day or in her chair. Nymeria is a little (a lot) hyper and was a rescue dog, we got her at 4 months. She gets possessive over her toys or whatever (or whoever)  she's playing with and gets a little aggressive  with Charlie but has never injured her. Nymeria does it less as she grew up but Charlie is scared so we always are at her side when it should occur. However Charlie started acting like a puppy again and would prance around the floor when she saw us. I believe having a younger dog helped give Charlie those extra few years but now I'm  not sure when she should be put down. I love seeing her play but it pains me whenever I see her legs give in.

DogCare,cdn84t,aroscoe,1,"Maybe getting a new dog, but current dog is sorta fearful/aggressive. Advice?","Hello! Please forgive the loooong post. Hope it belongs here. Also posted in r/AskVets and r/dogtraining. It's kinda multiple issues that are culminating because of the potential new pup. 

My pup, Joey, is a 5 year old bichon/shih tzu/poodle mix. Neutered, 20lbs, adorable. He was the absolute sweetest little thing in his younger years. Loved the vet, was okay with the groomer, adored his lhasa sister Lizzy (she was here when we got him, she has since passed). We went out of town for a week for my grandfather's funeral a few years ago and he has been having aggression trouble since (Lizzy was still around during the beginning of the aggression). He barks like mad (I mean, it's really bad) when even a bird is right outside the window of the house, he WILL bite/attack strangers in and around the house (it started with my cousin, but I thought it was because he was stomping around the house and swinging a towel, but he has since bitten delivery people, other visitors, etc), and all of this is with him being in a generally fearful state. He sounds angry but his other behavior and posture screams ""help me mom, I'm scared!"" On Thanksgiving, we have tons of people over and another dog, and he just sits in his cage the whole time, pretty okay but also pretty clearly stressed and shut down. He seems to have a problem with sounds, mainly. Scrolling the mouse wheel too fast scares him, the fire alarm low battery beep sends him hiding under the bed for hours, etc. I feel so bad because I just can't seem to ease his stress/fear. 

We found a dog (1 year old sheltie/dach mix, so amazing, 17lbs so not so big shockingly) while volunteering at the shelter who my SO and I fell in absolute love with. I made the mistake of changing her name in my head and I dream about her. The way the shelter works is that you can't just tour the facility and pick a dog, you have to show up the day they are available for visiting/adopting and see the dog out in the visitor pen, and there is often a long line out the door the mornings of adoption days (usually lots of dogs go available the same day). We don't want to lose her, but her date is this Friday. All members of household + dogs must be present at time of adopting (makes sense). We are obviously worried about a) bringing Joey to a shelter setting and being surrounded by people and the smell of other animals, especially stressed/sad ones, and b) how he would react with a sister again. 

Outside of the house, Joey is kinda fine. He shakes in the car when he thinks he's going to the vet lol, but otherwise is fine in public. He let people pet him at the store when trying on harnesses, he sits quietly on the sidewalk with my housekeeper when she goes to pick up her kids from school (lots of people traffic), and when he stays at her apartment, he doesn't bark or anything unless someone knocks on the door, which is pretty typical of dogs, yeah? I wonder if his aggression stems from my mom's house, and the fact that she is in a wheelchair (I know dogs have a sense about those things), and that I was away at college when his aggression started and just now got home. My SO and I are planning on moving out together soon, and taking Joey more than likely. But until then, he would definitely be around, and in this house for a few months at least. He is pretty okay with my cousins dog, Ollie, who is a big mutt, probably Ridgeback and golden mix? Something like that. Big boy, always happy, smacks Joey with his tail lol. He's cautious but generally okay with Ollie in the house. My SO's mom's dog, Max, a dachshund, also has visited a few times and Joey seemed even more okay with Max because Max is very relaxed and calm, and he is older (13, Ollie is about 9). I personally am not so worried about Joey and another dog as a sister, but others are, from his aggression to money supporting ourselves for the first time, plus two dogs.

Anywayyyyyy, any advice on what to do? Should I just let my heart break and let the potential pup be adopted by someone else? Should we medicate Joey and calm him for the visit and the introductory weeks/months? Sidenote, vet gave us doggy Xanax and it had the opposite effect, and we denied the Prozac because she said it could change his personality which I don't want, because he's so funny and cute and just, my pup, when not in defense mode. I was interested in trying CBD or other cannabis-based solutions, but she said the evidence in dogs isn't super strong rn. We are in Illinois so medically it's legal, and of course there are ""hemp treats"" and such sold all over for dogs, but idk how much I trust it now? Should we try it and if so, what? Or other solutions for calming? The adaptil collar seemingly did nothing for him. He doesn't usually even eat the vetriscience composure treats and we haven't seen any results from them. Any other calming suggestions? Someone would always be able to be home to monitor the dogs, I've had plenty of puppies and old dogs in the past, so I'm not worried about new dog in the house besides because of Joey. I'm just so lost.

TL;DR: Current 5yo dog Joey is super fearful of a lot of things, leading to aggression. He grew up with a sister who passed, and we are thinking of getting a new dog Friday. We are worried about bringing him to the shelter to meet her/adopt (required), so we want to find a way to calm him. We are also worried about how he will react to having a sister again, but I think that part is really okay. I just want them both happy and healthy and I would die for Joey, and am in looooove with the potential pup. Help?",1,1563223630

Also, how to keep a dog away from something that can't be moved and is a chew temptation.","My dog suddenly decided that a stump in the backyard is the most interesting thing he comes across. He'd been peeing on it, he climbed on it, and last night he gnawed on it. Several times, despite being tossed his favorite chew toy.

He'd been behaving normally, so it didn't occur to me for a few hours later than tree bark can make him sick. I went outside and examined the stump. Surprisingly I found no teeth marks or signs that new bark had been taken off. I guess we caught him quickly.

From google, my best layman's guess is that it's a spruce so not inherently toxic. So today I'm watching him like a hawk to make sure he can still eat and digest things. I even gave him some peanut butter for encouragement. Unfortunately, we've only had him for three weeks (with fourth of july and a block party in there) so his personality is still emerging and it would be hard to say what ""normal"" behavior is. How quickly he eats his food, how often he whines, how much he sleeps vs plays with chew toys don't have a baseline for normal yet.

He‚Äôs never been outside the yard (unless he accidentally got out) and we want to take him for walks and the beach but he‚Äôs SO AFRAID!! 
Any advice on how to help him not be so nervous?? We got him out the gate but he just lays down and wouldn‚Äôt move cause he was so afraid. Should I start little by little with treats? Should I use calming treats to help him?

Another question is, what can I give to help him with his joints/ bones/ muscles? Any advice or suggestions for what‚Äôs worked for you and your loved ones? I started buying him joint health treats but I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs anything better like some type of formula or diet? 

One last question, how do I bathe a HUGE dog that is afraid of water and hasn‚Äôt been bathed since he was a puppy!?!? I‚Äôve been brushing him lots and I can already make a whole new dog with all the hair I‚Äôve brushed off. I also bought him dog wet wipes to wipe him but that can only do so much :/

My girl and I want to give Wall-E the best life we can and what he deserves but he‚Äôs very timid and shy (sometimes a scaredy-cat even tho he‚Äôs HUGE!) I‚Äôm open minded to your guys‚Äô suggestions/ advice! Thank you for your time!

Today after the 6th or 7th time my wife and I caught the news talking about the new FDA report about certain dog foods causing heart conditions, my wife asked me to look into it further.  We have always got her the Natures  Domain bags carried by Costco which is one of the brands the FDA put in question.  I have thought about switching our dog to Merrick for a while because I've heard its suppose to be good for dogs but Merrick is also on the list.  A family friend who is a Veterinarian at the Vet clinic at Washington State University said there is more research that needs to be done.   


I guess my question is, is this a lot of hype?  I love my dog but she has about the weakest stomach of any dog I have ever had so I'm hesitant to start switching foods if this isn't something that I need to address immediately.

DogCare,c8kbh8,chone_si,7,Which is better: boarding or leaving them at home and hiring a sitter?,"We have two dogs (2 and 10 years old) that we don't bring with us on vacation. Which is better for the dogs?

Option one is taking them to a boarder for the week. We've done this before and I always feel super guilty leaving them there. The older one has anxiety and I always worry about how he does there. Nothing bad has ever happened, but I still worry. Also, one of the downsides to the boarder is that we're subject to their hours so if we get back too late, they have to stay another night, so it's less convenient.

The other option is to hire a sitter and have her come to the house to feed them. We have a doggy door with a fenced in yard, so they can go out and run out their energy whenever they want. My concern here is if they think we abandoned them at home. At the boarder, they kind of understand what's going on because they've done it before. But when we leave them at home, they're used to us coming back at the end of the day. They're also used to sleeping in our bed.

Is one of these options less stressful for the pups than the other? I'd prefer to keep them home so they're just there when we get home, but I want to do what's best for them!",13,1562132722

My summer schedule is kinda busy being a full time student and part time worker. I‚Äôve been spending all  of my weekends with my dog keeping him busy (lake, walks, new tricks, visiting dog friends, daycare, etc)

I‚Äôm gone for about 12 hours a day with one break and during that I come home and let him out. I‚Äôve been filling up a kong with peanut butter and training treats and freezing it to give him on Mondays so he has something to do while I‚Äôm gone

-also, I cant afford to take him to daycare daily or get a dog walker and getting rid of him is completely out of the question-

I obviously don‚Äôt want to always give him a peanut butter filled kong since I, like most people, don‚Äôt want him to get overweight.

I was curious as to whether or not anyone has used a frozen kong with wet dog food to keep their dog busy during the day and feed them the remaining in dry dog food in the evenings and how that has played out? 

He‚Äôs currently, and always has been, on a dry food diet.

This may very well be a bad idea but I‚Äôm just looking for pros/cons, whether this is healthy for my dog and stories of whether or not people have done this with their dog (which I‚Äôm sure SOMEONE has) before I buy wet dog food lol

DogCare,c3i3pi,daisybunny,3,"young chihuahua w/ darkened skin, hair loss, itchiness","Hi Dog Moms and Dads! 

When I rescued my chihuahua Milo 3 months ago, he had a very soft and hairless belly, but otherwise full hair on his neck and legs. Over the first month I had him, he was very itchy and his skin started to darken a little bit. Mid-May I took him to the vet because he was continually SO itchy and his skin seemed rash-y. They gave him really expensive allergy meds that did \*nothing\*, and the issue has gotten worse. He now really has very little hair on his neck, and when you get up close, there is hair missing in specific spots he itches. Most importantly, he is super itchy!

I made another appointment for Monday, but any ideas what it might be? Someone suggested mites, but when I mentioned that to the vet today, and they shut me down. He eats a very pricey and natural Canadian dog food that he LOVES and I don't think that it's because of that. 

Appreciate your thoughts &amp; help!!

She's stopped coughing but she's still sneezing. I'm starting to become concerned.


For background, she runs in around in the woods when we go on hiking. She sniffs a lot of stuff. No changes in diet. Possibly environmental since she's in a different province but idk.


Not lethargic or off her food.

DogCare,c37b2l,jaes_,10,Is my dog faking illness?,"So, last night my dog started screaming and yelping in pain. When I checked on him his stomach was hard and he was clearly in pain (couldn‚Äôt step down a 4-5 inch step without crying, couldn‚Äôt stand against something on his back legs, and could not be carried like normal). He cried through the night and woke up 2-3 times whining. He was still acting normal for the most part, tail wagging and all. I took his dog food away and fed him some pumpkin to help his bowel movements and after a few hours he pooped solid with pumpkin clearly in it, (does this rule out a blockage?). 

The next morning he was still crying and screaming as if someone was killing him and clearly in discomfort so I took him to the vet as soon as possible. On the way to the vet, he was moaning and groaning as he had been. As we were being seen, it was like all his problems went away. The vet was able to pick him up, she felt all over him, and did the exam without a single reaction from him! His stomach was even normal feeling. I probably looked crazy because it was as if nothing was ever wrong. The vet said since he had no reaction to her poking and prodding, the only other option would be to do an x-ray and bloodwork (over $400). She recommend I continue feeding him pumpkin and adding chicken broth to his water, since he hadn‚Äôt been drinking either. 

As soon as we left, he pooped another solid/pumpkin poop. He was acting like his normal self for a few hours and did the screaming thing maybe once or twice since the vet visit. 

He has no interest in eating non edible things, and the only thing I could think of him swallowing is a piece of rawhide free/softish bone that he has been chewing for the past few weeks. It got down to a really small size and I assume he may have eaten it too fast or something. He‚Äôs quite an attention hog, and I was busier than usual the past day or so, so he didn‚Äôt get as much time as normal. Is it possible he‚Äôs over exaggerating a small stomach ache because he knows he‚Äôll get special treatment? Should I be concerned if the vet didn‚Äôt find anything wrong? Is a blockage possible with solid poop? He isn‚Äôt vomiting or showing any other symptoms. 

Thanks!",6,1561099948

They did some blood work to make sure she‚Äôs healthy enough for sedation and checked protein levels among other things. Everything was normal including her protein levels. Her biopsy is scheduled for next week, so for the next week everything is just up in the air. 

She is a pit bull mix. Not sure what she‚Äôs mixed with, we‚Äôve always thought Dalmatian, since she has small spots all over her body. Since she‚Äôs got the pink skin, I know skin cancer is a high risk for her, although I don‚Äôt really let her out in the sun for long stretches. 

Her energy levels and alertness are normal. Her appetite is normal. She doesn‚Äôt seem sensitive in the area. I have a three year old and a one year old human and they touch her and rough house with her all over and she‚Äôs still loving it. When touching her leg to take the picture, she didn‚Äôt flinch or tense up. Since finding this thing, I‚Äôve been looking through her fur for more, and haven‚Äôt found anything. She‚Äôs fully vaccinated and otherwise healthy. She‚Äôs about 5 years old. As far as other medical history, when she was 1 year old, she had an ear infection and last year she had a UTI. Both infections only occurred once.  

Does anyone have any idea what this looks like? Does it look like cancer or anything else? Any advice is welcome! Thank you!

Has anyone got any tips for getting a dog to put on weight? We have a 14 month border collie who we just don't seem to be able to get to eat. I know collies aren't food motivated but he just doesn't care about food at all. 

We were feeding a high protein food which he seemed to struggle to eat the recommended amount so we switched to the same brand but a higher carb food so more calories per unit weight. 

But... He still struggles to eat the recommended amount for his weight and he feels pretty skinny. I can feel his ribs and spine. He's got a border collie friend who's got a nice layer of puppy fat on him and looks so much chunkier than our skinny boy. 

Each morning we weigh out the higher end amount for his food for his weight range but the only way we seem to be able to get him to actually take food is to feed him by training. He isn't motivated enough to eat kibble out of food toys unless we put some treats in there as well but he won't eat all his food in this way, he seems to get bored. 

We've been trying to feed him lots of food through training and then the last amount of food with some wet food mixed in. But he does get to the point where he spits the kibble out during training because he doesn't want it and he won't finish off the kibble even mixed with wet food. 

Do border collies get a bit tubbier with age? He seems to have lost about a kilo since Christmas as well but he's had vet checkups and he's fine. The vet wasn't too worried but he just feels so skinny. 

Is there anything we can add to his diet to help?",7,1559941007

The Pomeranian has had diarrhea on and off for about a week.  Gave her some Science Diet ID can food along with an over the counter PetSmart anti-diarrhea medicine.  Just when she was about over her diarrhea spell, the Border Terrier sorta had it too.  Finally ended up giving both just boiled chicken and white rice.

Yesterday afternoon out of the blue, the border terrier just vomited up a tiny bit of undigested kibble.  He was fine, the rest of the evening.  Now this morning, he vomited more with two piles; one was more undigested kibble and the other looked to be a slight yellowish mucus.

The Pomeranian is fine, but now I don't know what to do with this vomiting issue. Is there anything over the counter I can buy him?  He's been his normal self, but I don't know the origin to this and I'm unsure what I can do to help him feel better.

I was hoping for some input regarding combining different flea and tick preventative treatments. 

Right now I live in Morris county NJ, in which I would consider a pretty wooded part of the county. I‚Äôm using Frontline right now, recommenced by my Vet, and have found two ticks on my pup. One latched, a month ago, one that did not latch tonight. 

I pay extremely close attention to my pup, and caught both right away. 

I‚Äôm wondering if I can/should be doing more, or if I‚Äôm just being over precautions. I‚Äôve never owned a dog in an area such as this, and ticks where never a concern until now.

DogCare,bu668v,eitakesor,2,Dog food for multiple life stages,"As a former employee of a well known pet store, my knowledge of pet food has been skewed by management and the dog food reps that came to teach us about the products. 

We have 3 dogs.. a 10lb Pomeranian and a 4lb chihuahua that are both 10 years old and an almost 40lb Shepherd retriever mix that is 9 months old. Our vet said we could start switching the puppy over to adult food when we‚Äôre almost done with the food we have now. So we‚Äôre trying to figure out the best food to feed the puppy and possibly all 3 dogs. 

We recently switched the two older and smaller dogs from Simply Nourish Limited Ingredient Salmon and Sweet Potato small breed to the senior food (but not small breed). The older and smaller dogs both have allergies to chicken and they do well on this food. The puppy is currently eating Science Diet chicken meal &amp; barley puppy food which is what the rescue was feeding her when we adopted her. She seems to be fine on it and is a healthy weight but she only eats about 2 cups out of the recommended 4 cups a day for her size. 

So ideally we would like to have all the dogs eating the same food because of course they think the grass is greener on the other side and want each other‚Äôs food. It‚Äôs been rough trying to feed them separately. 

I know the Costco food is popular but I‚Äôm not sure about the all life stages part. Does anyone know if that is a legit claim? Do senior dogs and adult dogs need different nutrients? Should I stick to the Simply Nourish senior food and maybe just put the puppy on Costco‚Äôs salmon food?",11,1559080749
DogCare,btudw0,pan1cm0d3,7,Do dogs have sudden onset behaviors?,"As we dog owners/lovers know, all doggos have a personality. Most generalized characteristics they maintain since puppy hood and dont usually suddenly change a behavior without cause..... or so I thought. 

I've had my dog for 2 years. He is a pure bred corgi Male (sometimes breed and gender matter). He has never ever ever howled. No matter what trigger we give him, sirens, other dogs, nothing would get him to howl in response. He would bork his brains out but no howl. 

All of a sudden, last week, I hear howling. At first I thought maybe it was my neighbors dogs but it was too high pitched. She has 2 full grown akitas, this was a little dog howl. I look out my door and there he is, on his lead, head back, howling. After a couple minutes I hears sirens in the distance and figured it was in response to that. 

A couple days later this happens again. I go listen, no sirens. Of course I realize they could have been in his range but not mine. This continues randomly all day. Never heard sirens. And on top of it as soon as he noticed I was watching, he would stop. 

Fast forward to tonight. Hes in the back office with my fiancee on his chair in the widow, laying down, chin resting on the window, howling. They're long high howls. No sirens, no people outside, no animals in sight. Hes done it 5 or 6 times in the last couple hours. 

Do dogs have random onset behaviors? Is this something he just does now, for no reason besides he likes to, maybe?",8,1559009414

DogCare,btp8yi,KiraCat89,0,Can Chew Treats Kill Your Dog?,"Chewable treats. You've probably given your dog dozens of them and he loves them. They clean their teeth and keep them occupied for hours. It's a perfectly harmless canine treat, isn't it? Wrong. Chewable treats can hurt or even kill your dog. If you are concerned about your dog's health, continue reading.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;Why are chewy treats dangerous?

The two most popular types of edible chewable treats are those made from raw leather and those made from compressed vegetable protein. When your dog chews these treats, he can swallow large pieces. These pieces of chewable treats cannot be digested by your pet and can lodge in its intestines. Intestinal blockages can kill your dog in a matter of hours. They can cause a condition called intestinal strangulation, i.e. when the blood flow is cut off in the intestines. The intestinal tissue then begins to die and rot. 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;How do I know if my dog has a blockage?

If your dog has a blockage, you may experience some of the following symptoms. They may vomit, refuse to eat, regurgitate food, have diarrhea or abdominal pain. If your dog has any of these symptoms, you should consult a veterinarian as soon as possible. If they have a blockage, it won't resolve itself. They will have to be operated on.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;Should I stop giving my dog chewy treats?

You don't have to stop giving him chewy treats. However, you should monitor the use of these treats. When you can't be around your pet, remove the candy. When your dog has used the candy in small pieces, replace it.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that as the owner of a pet, it is your responsibility to ensure the health of your dog. We all love pets and it would be a shame to lose them for something as simple as a chewy treat. So keep an eye on your pet and help him live a long and happy life.

We also happen to have a 2 bedroom apartment with one bedroom that we quite frankly never use and is empty except for the dog crate, a bookcase, and a box of Lego.

For a while, we used to call that room her bedroom and leave her in there when both my bf and I had to leave the house. It gave her room to stretch her legs and wander around. We're not at the point of trusting her to wander the whole apartment unsupervised, but just the one room was fine.

Until one day, I guess she got bored, and chewed up all the Lego and all the books and the bookcase. Welllll ... We stopped leaving her in her bedroom after that. She just got crated instead.

I believe in crate training and she doesn't mind being crated, but I'd like to give her the option to roam a bit again. However, I don't want to completely surrender the room to her, and never be able to put anything in it.

Her eating the bookcase was weird and a one-off, but I don't trust her alone with furniture any more. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions regarding:
How to block off half the room for a reasonable price (a gate large enough to stretch across it is quite expensive)
Or
How to get her not to eat the furniture, thereby eliminating the need for a fence (she doesn't eat the furniture in the other rooms, but she's generally always supervised).
Or
Any other suggestions regarding how to deal with this extra bedroom so puppy can be in it unsupervised in a safe manner

We asked if there was any treatment at all that might help, and the vet said no. He advised we put our dog down.

This was a very sudden diagnosis. Our dog has had a persistent cough in the past, but his vet said it was just hair getting caught in his throat. I believe he's actually had heart worms for quite some time. At this point, he has pneumonia, and he's very lethargic.

Because our dog seemed perfectly fine just a few days ago (playing, running, acting like nothing was wrong), we opted to bring him home to research further. We found some posts online about treatment with black walnut drops. However, like most alternative remedies, the websites look pretty hokey and conspiracy theory-ish.

However, despite working with him consistently since he was a puppy, and trying every recommendation imaginable, he still does not come when I call him. He comes when we're inside, but when i need him to come to me when we're out in the yard, he simply won't do it. 
He looks at me, knows what I'm telling him to do, then simply walks the other direction. If i sound angry, he will lay down and let me come get him, then walk to the house on his own, but simply will not come if I call him. Not even if I'm holding a bug, smelly junk of meat and telling him to come get his treat. 
He just... doesn't want to come inside or come to me and stop playing. He will sit or lay down if I say that instead, and will usually wait for me to come get him. But that's not enough. And I would like to trust him enough to take him to play outside elsewhere, but I cant if he wont come when I call to him. 

Is there anything I can try? Food and treats aren't exciting enough for him, acting happy and excited so he thinks I want to play doesn't work, being stern just gets him to lay down and I still have to go get him. 
He's almost all grown up now, so I'm worrying that it will just become even more difficult to teach this to him if he can't get it soon.

Thank you in advance for any ideas!",10,1558087461
DogCare,bpljg3,Petique71,1,Why walk the dog?,"What are the benefits?

**1. Helps prevent obesity in your pet (and yourself)**   
Keeping both of your weight on target keeps health problems at bay. The introduction of a daily walk of just 30 minutes a day can lower your pooch‚Äôs weight by 15%. (It won‚Äôt hurt your own girth, either.)

**2. Uses up excess energy**  
Since unexercised canines tend toward destructive behaviors, daily exercise will minimize the risk of your dog‚Äôs energy on your home and accessories. In the same way a trip to a playground helps over-active toddlers burn excess energy, a nice brisk walk works wonders toward calming an over-energetic dog. If your dog comes from a herding or hunting breed (such as a collie or retriever), they need significantly more exercise. You might consider taking them to a dog park, where they can safely run off-the-leash.

**3. Provides bonding through training** 

Most dogs do not instinctively know how to properly walk on a leash. As you train them to listen to and obey your cues, you enjoy quality bonding-time to help her behave well around other animals as well as humans you encounter along the trail.

**4. Enables your dog to safely enjoy the sights and sounds of the outside world**  
Instilling proper social cues and behavior, regular walking socializes pets. This is an important part of growth. What‚Äôs more, walking regularly through busy neighborhoods satisfies curious noses. This is important since a [**dog‚Äôs sense of smell**](https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dogs-sense-of-smell-facts) is 10 to 100 (some experts say even 1,000,000 times¬†more refined than that of humans).¬†  
**5. Stimulate their mind**  
Bored dogs often turn toward naughty behavior. Regular daily walks offer plenty of mental stimuli for your pooch. Additionally, herding dogs hone their problem-solving skills for ‚Äúherding‚Äù you as you navigate through the streets.

**A few things to bear in mind before you walk:** 

* Bring bags to pick up your dog‚Äôs poo. Cleaning up after your pooch is your responsibility. 
* Bring water and a portable dish and give your dog frequent water breaks. 
* Outfit your dog with an appropriately-sized, sturdy leash (we produce [**reflective leashes**](https://www.petique.com/dogs/travel/pet-leash.html) in a variety of sizes and colors). 
* Pay attention to the weather. Avoid walking on days that are too hot or too cold. Consider the impact our dog‚Äôs paws will have on cement. Skip the day‚Äôs walk and play inside in adverse conditions.",3,1558059728

I have since upped his activity to three walks a day, and he now eats a little over 3/4 of a cup of grain free Purina One twice a day. He has stopped gaining weight, but it's coming off at an almost unnoticeable rate.

I usually let him out in my backyard to do his business, but I discovered today that he just eats a bunch of grass while he is out there. He doesn't vomit inside or anything, and I've never seen issues with worms, so I'm guessing it could be a fiber issue. I'm considering buying green beans or carrots to mash up and add to his food, but I don't want to add more caloric intake to his diet. I can't really take him out for a fourth walk, but I'm worried that less food for more fiber could throw off other nutritional issues.

DogCare,bofbu7,casual_cocaine,3,Taking full ownership of my family dog (Maverick - English Cream),"Background: 
English Cream 4-5 years old. 

The spring semester of my senior year in high school we bought an English cream to live with our family (my mom and brother). I then moved away to my out of state school and would mostly see family during the holidays. At the time we lived in the suburbs and had a fairly big house with a lawn and backyard where my dog would spend his days lounging, but 3 years ago my mom and brother moved practically inside the city and now live in a four story condo with practically no yard and tons of stairs that my dog hates to go on. Both my mom and younger brother are extremely busy with either work or extracurriculars + school. 

Basically Maverick has gotten overly fat and I know that when I come home is when he gets the most active. I take him on 2-3 mile walks daily and I‚Äôm the most proactive in taking care of him. My mom and I agreed that it‚Äôs in the best interest if I take him to live with me as he would have more exposure to better weather and a more active setting. 

Problem:
My concern is any potential psychological impact that could have on him if I take him away from his natural home setting. Of course he would be well taken care of with me and I‚Äôm not worried that the impact will be caused by me, but more so I‚Äôm worried about the drastic change in environment (not seeing the other family members and a new house setting), 

How do dogs handle change in ownership and change in house setting? Overall Maverick would benefit the most by living with me as I have the time and love he needs to become a healthier and more active dog. Thanks in advance for any suggestions or guidelines. 


TL;DR

Taking ownership of our family dog who needs more exposure to physical activity and I have the ability to offer this for him. This would mean bringing him to another state and probably only seeing my mom and brother on rare occasions.",3,1557816467

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting on here so I apologize for any mistakes I make. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just as the title says, my dog, who is a 5 year old Goldendoodle, seems to have trouble going to the bathroom outside. She was my parents dog for 4 years but they had moved into an apartment from a house and wouldn't have the time to walk her so I took her. I do live in an apartment near a busier street and the house that she grew up in was in a very quiet neighborhood.  But everytime we go outside, she seems either not interested in going to the bathroom (even when she tells me she wants to go out) or she knows what she wants to do but seems to nervous to do it.  There are other dogs in the apartment complex, one of which she is best friends with and if that dog goes to the bathroom(either #1 or #2) then my dog will go. My dog doesnt seem to have much issue with peeing but when it comes time to poop, she struggles. She doesn't seem to be in pain or struggle to do the actual motion but rather the actual event.  Am I confusing her when I go to pick it up? I did start her on a probiotic just a few days ago to see if that would help. When I take her on walks, she'll pee right away but its always a toss up if she'll poop. There are days where it takes her 45 mins to an hour just to go poop which I'm always happy if she does ( I praise her and she gets a treat) but on cold days, being out there for 45 mins is just not ideal.

I was looking to adopt an older dog that would be mature and just hang out with me and she seemed perfect. As soon as I brought her home, I knew there was no way she was 5. She has so much energy. I took her to the vet and the vet said judging by her teeth, she is a little over one year old. She is still a puppy. She is such a wonderful dog with good manners and she is so sweet and well behaved, but she is so needy just like a puppy. She needs almost constant attention. She is always moving and won't hold still unless she is being touched. She can't keep herself busy. I've walked her 5 miles a day and it makes no difference in her energy. She won't go outside without someone going with her. She has separation anxiety and she also needs a lot of exercise. All of this and I am starting college classes next week while still working a full time job. Between her and work right now, I have almost 0 time to myself. That doesn't even include school. I can't even take a nap by myself without her needing my attention of being in bed with me. I did not sign up for a puppy. I ideally wanted an older dog that would be okay with staying home by themselves for a few hours and just hanging out with me while I study or am at work (I have an office job that I am allowed to bring my dog to) and that I would be able to exercise moderately.

Me and my gf adopted a rescue back in January. He's just over a year old and he's been great. Just two weeks ago my girlfriend had surgery which kept her in and mostly on bed rest for a few days, and at the house in general the past two weeks. 

Around that time I noticed our dog was having liquid poops. Sometimes they would have a red tint to them, sometimes they would have grass, and sometimes he would just do a lot of squatting with either very minimal or nothing coming out. He's had some accidents during this time as well.

We run with nothing but ourselves. Women's running pants with pockets are a joke. He does have a backpack but I use that more for hiking so he can carry water for him and the other two pups (who aren't equipped for running). 

Where my house is we can either run sidewalks in town, of head up a back road. I prefer going the back way where there's less traffic, more shade, and more hills. This also allows Lucky to run in the grass as opposed to pavement. 

We usually run about three miles at a time, but I want to work up to a five mile average. I used to be able to run 10 miles no problem, it would be nice to do that every once and a while again.

Two weeks ago I adopted a rescue dog. She's about 14-16 months old. Before me she lived with a foster family, and before that was in a shelter. 

Since I've had her, she has absolutely refused to play with anything I got her. We go on walks (typically 1.5-2 hours a day) where she's super excited and runs around like crazy but as soon as we get home, she just plops on the ground and lays there for hours straight. And if she's not on the ground, she's in her crate lying down. 

Is this normal? Should I expect this to just be a readjustment period that will end eventually? (The agency I dealt with is telling me to chalk this up as a readjustment or ""decompression"" period that will end in a couple of weeks or so).",5,1555825124

DogCare,berrqb,Crislips,11,My dog has developed an aggression towards a specific dog.,"My dog is a large 3 year old dog. I got him at 10 weeks old and spent a lot of time trying to train/socialize him. He's always been extremely friendly towards both people and other dogs, even other dogs that seem disinterested in him.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved about 30 minutes away from my parents house about 5 months ago and I've been taking him to a new dog park. Things have been fine, except he seems to get in fights with 2 specific dogs. Now, I've seen him get bitten by other, snappy dogs, and not react, I've seen him share toys, water bowls, get humped, etc. and he's never batted an eye. He just wags his tail and walks away. But these 2 particular dogs (different breeds, different owners, but both fluffy) seem to set him off. At first I thought they instigated him, but I'm not so sure that's the case anymore. The don't seem particularly aggressive towards him, but when he sees them he gets tunnel vision and it turns into a fight. Afterwards, he seems unphased by it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point where I'm embarrassed/afraid to take him to the dog park now because I don't want him to fight with these dogs. I don't know where this aggression came from. We live with my girlfriend and her dog, and I've never seen him get territorial. I don't know what causing this, and I don't know how to fix it. I would like to find a way to calm him down or train him so this doesn't happen, but I don't know how to discover the root of the problem. I'm open to taking him to a behavior trainer if need be, my most important concern is that everyone is safe and happy.",4,1555627149

We have purchased brown rice, shredded carrots, and no salt french beans that we are preparing tonight for her week's supply of food. In addition to this, the antibiotics we were given for her seem to have been very helpful. She has only cried for food once and that was this morning. She went to sleep around 9-10 this morning and when I came back from class at 2 she was still asleep, I played with her a little and then she started barking at my granddad mowing his lawn next door, which is something she hasn't done since getting sick. After that we played and she was very energetic. Hopefully the new food will have the nutrients she is lacking as the massive bad bacteria build up in her intestines is killed of by her antibiotics and the good bacteria is restored with her probiotic which we are going to sprinkle on her meals as instructed by the vet.

&amp;#x200B;

My son had a lot of friends over to the house and were loud and noisy for a few hours.. We took Ranger for a walk and he had a soft stool.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this week we got a new fence put up outside our house, and there was a lot of noise and commotion.. same result on our walk

My wife took Ranger to my son's track meet yesterday, and same result walking him home.  The track meet was busy and he did here the gun shots for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

We take him out every weekend to hardware stores/parks to be around people (plus did this when he was a puppy).. so we are just curious/wondering if there is ""too much"" commotion it's making him nervous?

DogCare,babnfn,katsock,12,Anyone safely carry their smallish dogs on hikes/bike rides in a back pack?,"Hello, first post for me!

I‚Äôm interested in biking (in a very safe area) while somehow carrying my [Dakota ](https://imgur.com/gallery/X7cM1HW) (25lbs) the few miles it takes to get to our local dog park, and carrying a back pack to carry my pup in on hikes where she may get a little too tired earlier than expected, and would like some feedback. 

Some points are

-my dog is very docile when being carried and incredibly calm
- I regularly bike 30 miles a day to and from work with about a 20lb load, and very confident in my ability to safely bike with my pup. 
-I only want to bike 2 miles to the dog park regularly and use this back pack hiking to help my pup on our hikes
-I used to regularly hike 5 miles a day with my Australian Shepard, who was strong enough to never tire while being too big to carry (duh). I am taking hiking slow with my current dog as we are still training and am not as confident with her as previous dogs at this time. 

Has anyone had any experience like this? Or recommendations? Or criticism?  I love exercising with my pup and GF and biking/hiking is my favorite activity. That being said I want to be safe, and this is my first dog that is this ‚Äúportable‚Äù and I know I must handle this situation differently from dogs I‚Äôve had in the past. ",7,1554602613
DogCare,b9llx6,KarelesReadit,9,Help for my Rescue's unknown ailment,"My emotional support dog and rescue Yorkie/Maltese (14 lbs) mix has always had a pimple on their right side. When cutting their hair this week I noticed that the pimple was more pronounced, never having protruded beyond her hair, even when cut very short. The pimple had grown 1/10 of an inch beyond her shortest haircut length of 1/4 of an inch (using trimmers). She loathes the trimmers and I was unable to finish her front leg. When I went to trim her remaining front left leg I grabbed her body to rotate her on the trimming area we always use and she yelped in pain. I looked at her pimple and it had inflamed to the size of a silver dollar. The pimple is now red, when it previously was only white and not inflamed less than 24 hours ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My previous first reaction was to zip her off to the vet. A recent injury at work, followed by my workman's compensation being contested/denied 3 months after the accident has had me operating off of savings for this time, and my transportation and available income is nearly nothing, from a relatively robust savings 4 months ago. Tending to my previous emotional support animal in their waning years has capped out my Care Credit card, and I am unsure what to do. I know of local Humane society support for a vet visit, but I don't know how to proceed timeline wise. Am I freaking out over nothing? Is this just a bugbite/infected pimple and a common occurrence I haven't come across? She is acting ""normal"" outside of when touched in the inflamed area.  


I'm not looking for an online vet, but rather a reality check and perhaps some shared experience of how fast I should be running out the door, if this is just commonplace for dogs, or should I see how things progress? Providing images.

This area will include his crate  with his bed, the designated potty area and plenty of room for him to move around.

I have been researching puzzle toys and other activities to keep our pup entertained, as well as training. We are also looking into having a neighbor stop by at least once a day to interact with our pup and possible take him outside a little. I am a morning person, so 1 hour walks in the morning are doable, but is it enough?

I've been one of the only people to really get him to come out of his shell and be happier, so I decided to try and help him get used to being in a home.

Didn't want to poop, but he was only at my house for about 12 hours at a time, most of which was when he was asleep. On Tuesday, he finally came to my home to stay until he gets adopted so I can help train him and get him used to people. The next day, the issues started. I have school for about 3-5 hours a day, depending on the day, so he has to hang out in a cage for that time. It's a huge wire cage that he can stand up, turn around and even jump in. He has plenty of padding and blankets so as not to be uncomfortable, plus toys, and a water bowl. I tried also putting his food in there the first day due to him not eating breakfast which worked but he also pooped everywhere, so I didn't do that today. He ended up with a little pink spot on his nose and poop everywhere when I finally got home. I took him out of course and washed everything and took him for a walk. Still wouldn't go to the bathroom. 

At this point, we went to my work place and he got to run around for about 4 hours and they gave him dinner since he's still technically their dog (I give him food in the mornings and when I don't work). He ate while he was there and apparently pooped so that was good. I took him home with me that night and when I took him to walk the first time, he peed, but the second time, around 11pm, nothing.

This morning, I got up earlier, set out food for him while I got ready, and then took him out for 15 minutes, but he refused to walk around and just sat there. I tried picking him up and moving him; he still refused to move. Any time he did move, he was trying to either go to my car or back to the house. I thought it was maybe how cold it was (it was about 19¬∞f and he's a medium to small dog, probably around 40lbs). So I brought him back inside, hoping he wouldn't poop in his cage again. I put him in his cage and head off to school for a few hours, then get back home to see him standing in poop again. I tried to take him out again and it's much warmer and sunnier and it was the same reaction... We came back inside and when I was cleaning out his cage, I come around the corner to see him pooping in the corner, having really watery brown diarrhea and then move a few inches and then have this weird brown, bloody mixture with a weird almost gooy looking texture. I instantly panicked and cleaned it up and hopped on here.

I can't take him back to the shelter until Friday due to my schedule and when they are open. I don't want to give up on him, but this has me seriously worried.


My questions:
Is this all stress and anxiety?? If so, will it go away soon? He is a very anxious dog, and he has separatation anxiety, which is why I tried a kong, but he wasn't interested in any treats I put in there because he's super picky with his food...

The food I've been feeding him is the same dry food as the shelter, but a different wet food. I know he'll eat the one I have as I've used it for treats before since again, he's picky af.

I'm mostly worried about the bloody stool though. I know this isn't normal for him! He's always had very consistent poops for as long as I've known him...

Ahhh honestly I'm just worried and really want any and all suggestions as I really do love this dog and want to give him a good life. The kennel I work at knows some of this is happening, but said a lot of it had to do with stress and having a new environment, but I just wanted to check...",7,1551906215

My three year old husky has terrible separation anxiety that makes finding suitable housing nearly impossible.  I've been renting rooms in houses but her anxiety always ends up causing tension with roommates.  Whenever I leave home she will begin screaming and crying until I'm back.  Her screams are so loud and blood-curdling that they can easily be heard from outside, so apartments and condos are a no go and I cant afford to buy a house.

I have tried nearly everything from rigorous exercise, thundershirt, puzzle toys, Rover and Wag, Kongs, medication, and I even shelled out $800 for a one on one trainer to work on the anxiety but nothing seems to work.

over the year I've had her, her anxiety has slightly lessened but I have a Petcam set up and after the first half hour I'm gone, the screaming begins.

Any advice on how to handle this or any other tips for anxiety I haven't tried yet?

DogCare,aut3pr,BrynSommers,6,Question about unvaccinated dogs,"I recently adopted two dogs. Before I owned them, they were my aunts. She's recently divorced and moved into an apartment that doesn't allow pets, so they've been moved into my care for the time being. 

For future reference, they're mother and daughter. The oldest is ten and the younger one is five years old. From the way my Aunt talked, the youngest has had quite a few health problems over the years.

Things have been going great, until now. It's getting around the time to give my other dog (1 year old) a booster vaccine. I wanted to make an appointment with the vet, and I realized I didn't really know when the other two would need their vaccines, or what they've already gotten. 

I called up my aunt, and was informed that while the oldest had gotten her first round of vaccines, the younger one had never been vaccinated. I'd like to get them both vaccinated, but I have a couple of questions. 

How do I go about vaccinating a dog who's never been vaccinated? Would our oldest be considered immunocompromised since she's an elderly dog? Or the youngest because she's never had one?

I've considered giving a round of shots to the younger two, and forfeiting the oldest ones vaccines since she got her first vaccination, but would that make the other two carriers to the illness? Is there a possibility they would give her the virus' if I did this?

I care about each of them, and I don't know what I can do to make sure each of them stay okay. I could contact the vet, but because they're both unlicensed I'm afraid of what they might do. ",7,1551143865

This morning she popped right up and ran downstairs for breakfast. Ate, went outside, went pee/potty, I was relieved, but ever since has continued to be very weird / wired / restless non-stop.  Very out of character for her as she usually naps most all day.

She's a 10lb, 6 yr old Chihuahua.  I have a hunch that it either IS abdominal pain of some sort (weird that she has had it for a good 14 hours now) or maybe even tooth pain (I do brush her teeth semi-regularly though, and she's not that old, so also a question mark).

DogCare,astnry,GRiZM0,8,Dog depressed after losing pack mates?,"Hi guys, 

I hope this is the right sub for this. 

So a little background: I have a 13yo Maltese/Yorkie mix (T). He grew up with a shih tzu mix (Gizmo) who had to be put to sleep at the early age of 8yo. 

After she was euthanized, he seemed fine. They were two peas in a pod, and neither cared for other dogs. They were stuck like glue and didn't ever desire to play with other dogs. I worried a lot about how T would take Gizmo not being around anymore. The absence of Gizmo didn't seem to effect him. Additionally, I had recently moved in with a boyfriend who had two dachshunds, one \~1.5yo and another 6mo puppy. After Gizmo passed, T started playing with the puppy, every day! I was surprised to see him have such a playful relationship with another dog, but was happy for him at the same time. 

I moved out of my now ex boyfriends place and now T seems depressed. I moved in with my grandparents who say that he is very reserved when I'm not home. He just sits in the crate with the door open, and despite them trying to coax him out, he won't. Once I get home, he perks up and is very excited. 

He's been very needy and constantly wants to cuddle. I don't mind in the slightest because he's my baby and is getting old. But I worry that he's no depressed without a ""pack"". I don't believe taking him to a dog park or doggy daycare will work because as I said, he doesn't like unfamiliar dogs. My boyfriend got his puppy at 12 weeks and it took a few months (or Gizmo passing, not sure) for him to take a liking to the puppy. 

T doesn't like playing with toys, but does enjoy walks. I just feel like I'm failing as a dog owner. I don't know how to give him that joy of a familiar pack. I should mention that getting another dog right now is not an option.

I now I don't have much time left with T, so I want to enrich his life as much as possible. Does anyone have any advice on how I can bring this joy back into his life that he had with the puppy? I hate to see him sulking around for the majority of the day. His favorite part of the day is when we climb into bed for cuddles. If I could just hold and cuddle him all day I would, but I can't for obvious reasons. 

Any advice is appreciated. It breaks my heart to see him like this and of course its making the break up even harder because I blame myself for taking away his pack.",4,1550696336

I‚Äôm seeking advice/help for my dog Sean. 

I got Sean from the local shelter about 9 months ago. He is a 7 year old pit bull mix. He is the sweetest animal I have ever met - he is extremely affectionate with my partner and I.  

The shelter warned us that he has fear based dog aggression. He loved people and the shelter would take him on outings to old folks homes and he would love on them. 

About 2-3 months in he started barking at strangers on walks. He used to be very interested in greeting people until one day he bit someone. He broke the skin but fortunately the person didn‚Äôt need stitches. 

Since then he goes absolutely crazy at  everything that moves- cars, people, animals, bikes, skateboards, motorcycle, scooters. 

We have tried many things since then and seen some progress. But he is still very far from his original friendly self. He is having problems with his nails because he‚Äôs beating them up so bad when he freaks out

We have reccomendations for dog behavioralists in our area. But treatment will cost a couple of thousand dollars which we have no way of affording. The behavioralists are all booked until May. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

Does anyone know of resources available to help dogs receive behavioral treatment their owners can‚Äôt afford?

I love my dog dearly and am distraught and unsure of what to can do. 

TLDR- my once very friendly rescued is now freaked out by everyone and everything and I‚Äôm seeking advice.

DogCare,amr21l,KKCooper,1,Our Pit mix died on Halloween and our other dog still hasn't recovered from the loss,"Our Pit/American Bulldog mix died unexpectedly of old age on Halloween, our other dog Cooper (Vizsla mix) has been completely depressed ever since and almost didn't eat anything till I coaxed him into eating with a little bit of shredded cheese in his food after almost a week of just picking at his food (like 8 pieces, desperate times...etc..) We finally got a new puppy in hopes that it would cure his depression and he'd finally have someone else to play with on Thanksgiving and he's still depressed. Lays in the corner and sleeps most of the day when he used to be a super happy and playful dog. We've bought him toys, given him bones, attempt to play with him constantly and he's just not the same. We don't pay more attention to the puppy than him and we make a point of TRYING to include them both in everything, but he's just not himself anymore.  


I understand dogs are just like people and he misses his best friend (so do I) but is he ever going to snap out of this? Is there anything I can do to get my old dog back or is he just going to be a miserable depressed lump in the corner of my couch for the rest of his days?  I miss my happy playful buddy, it breaks my heart just typing this out. Is there anything else we can do? ",4,1549211255

We have had some advice from the breeder and overall I'm confident we are doing all of the right things to keep her safe and happy. However today, she has gone off her food and hasn't eaten a thing or even had a drink. The biscuit that she usually gets after her morning walk has even been left untouched and she seems to be trying to hide it. We even gave her a different biscuit in case it was that she was just fed up of the same type but she just hid that one too. Does anyone have any insight as to whether this is normal behaviour?

We have to sweep essentially every couple of hours or we get giant clumps of hair all over the floor. Particularly because of this one pure bred chow we have named Lucky.

Lucky was originally my neighbors outside dog. They never really trained her or took care of her so she is basically a stray we took in. Since she was never trained she doesn't know commands like no, and yelling at her doesn't really effect her. She's just happy someone is paying attention to her. And she has a terrible habit of rolling in the dirt and we can't get her to stop. And that's on top of the fact that she's a thick furred breed like a chow in a hot place like Alabama. Oh and she has black hair on our white tile floor. And we still have two other dogs. So there's always a pile of hair on our floor.

Now the other day I saw a commercial about one of those robot vacuums that claimed it could take even the toughest of pet hair. I never looked into these things because I assumed this was too much of a job for it. But with the way technology is i figure maybe there is one out there that can handle the job. I tried google'ing it, but it seems like every one claims it can handle it. But I'm pretty sure a standard one couldn't handle this job. But at the same time I have ZERO knowledge on them so I could be wrong. Anybody have any experience with these and dog hair? You think it could handle my situation? I don't expect it to take care of the job for me, but it would be nice if I didn't have to sweep as much.

I am a dog-sitter, and an animal lover - have been dog-sitting for years ... but I am troubled by my current situation.  


I am dog-sitting for a woman, staying in her place and looking after her two dogs for 19 days. I arrive at her place and the house is a real mess, I am bleaching everything before I use it ... blech... but the dogs are also very dirty. One dog has a poopy butt. I gave both dogs baths on my first day here - but the one with the poopy butt won't let me near her butt. She tries to bite me. I splashed the butt as much as I could in the tub, but even splashing it made her try to bite me.  


Usually I would solve this with a warm soapy butt wash, a quick trim - problem solved... this time not so much.  


It's about day 3 now, the poop-butt just came inside with a poop stuck about the size of a baby carrot. I managed to get her back into the tub to splash around, but she was not happy. I got about 90% of the poop off, but it's still not clean enough for my standards. I am currently in the guest room with the door closed, because the poopy butt is not welcome in my room. Dog owner expects me to sleep with the dogs in the bed... I'm thinking though - tomorrow the poop will be dry and even worse for this little dog when she needs another bathroom break...

DogCare,a72chb,Serotoninneeded,1,Please help! My dog was attacked!,"Please help! This is going to be a long post because I want to be detailed.

My dog is a Yorkshire terrier mix (she's a rescue, I'm not sure what or if she's mixed with something else) and she's very small, small enough to fit in my purse. While I was in the other room I heard a horrible noise, it didn't even sound like her. 
I ran to see what happened and so did my mom. 
My mom's boyfriend's dog (a medium  sized dog, has not acted aggressive before this as far as I know) was holding her down, but my mom got her away and handed her to me. There was blood all over her. 
We washed her off and the only injury we can physically see is a bite on her shoulder with two puncture marks. 
She has trouble walking, she is breathing heavily, she doesn't want to move very much, and she looks stiff and scared. It's been like this for about six hours now. I'm trying to be comforting but don't know how beyond just talking to her and petting her gently. 
She doesn't want food or water. 
She's drooling even though she never drools. Her breathing sounds like soft snoring. 
She peed on my bed because she can't down herself. 
Her stomach was growling a lot before, but not anymore. 
Weird thing with her back? When I put my hand on her back it feels kinda squishy and crunchy, like the muscles not the spine. It feels like there's fluid in her back moving around. 

Please help, I don't know which one of us is more scared, me or my dog.

DogCare,a704ld,OfficerZooey,1,Questions about urinary care diet and allergies,"Some background for reference:

Aspen is a 4 year old English Golden Retriever. Approx. 2 years ago she began developing bladder stones (first treated as a recurring UTI, eventually found out it was crystals in her urine and bladder stones forming) and was put on the Hill's Science Diet c/d formula. We tried switching her off after dissolving the first stone but the problem came right back-so she's been on the c/d ever since to control the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being a golden, allergies/skin issues aren't surprising and she last week was diagnosed with a yeast infection in her left ear. Given a one time treatment and allergy medication (apoquel) to take 2x/day for 2 weeks, then 1x day following. Her left ear has had ongoing problems for probably a little over a year, but usually a few days of an antiseptic wipe would take care of it. She also chews at her paws and rubs her face on the ground to itch, so I know there are some underlying allergy issues, but she isn't biting/scratching so bad that she is losing hair or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've long suspected that she may be allergic to something in her food, but feel like we can't do anything to switch that due to it being prescribed for her urinary care issues. Has anyone had luck with diets that support urinary care that AREN'T Hills c/d formula? The itching and ear are better since taking the apoquel, but I'd like to avoid a daily allergy pill for her remaining life if this can be addressed other ways. Also, I know that the food isn't the best quality and I want her to have a long and happy, healthy life. We're already paying quite a bit for the food so cost isn't a huge issue, especially if a daily allergy pill could be eliminated. ",7,1545055863

DogCare,a57arj,cheshiredoge,1,Too much excess skin on dog,"I have an eleven year old golden lab. He's got a lot of excess skin on the underside of his neck because he used to be overweight.

He keeps scratching at his neck area, really hard and really frequently. It seems like the folds of excess skin under his neck are trapping moisture and giving him itches, maybe a mild skin rash or infection. It does smell a bit too, but it's not very bad. 

I want to find ways to control this before it gets any worse. If possible, I also want to avoid a skin fold resection, because my dog is old and I don't want him to have to go through that.

Another issue is that we live in a tropical, humid, rainy climate. My dog likes to get wet too, so this definitely contributes to the skin problem, because the skin folds dont have much time to dry out. 

Anyone got any ideas to control the skin folds? I've been considering using clips to clip the skin up above his neck, so the skin under his neck will stretch out, won't trap as much moisture. Other than that, I can't think of anything.",4,1544538890

DogCare,a4wvl3,pm_me_cute_keyboards,1,Post-spay care for three legged dog,"Our second dog (Ezri) is getting spayed on Thursday, and I'm hoping to get some advice. Post-op care for our first dog (Seven) was fairly easy, but she has all four legs, was only about 20 lbs, and was our only dog at the time. Ezri is about 35 lbs right now, and is missing her front left leg (removed shortly after birth). She's not the most coordinated pup to begin with, and I expect it to be worse with pain meds/stitches. 

1. Separation. I figured it would be best to separate the two of them for the first few days (in case Seven tries to lick her stitches for her) but, assuming Ezri's healing goes well, when do you guys think it would be okay to return her to their shared kennel? 

2. Bathroom. Ezri is pretty well house trained, but because she's missing a limb, walking (or hopping, in her case) requires a lot of core strength. I'm concerned that getting to the grass to do her business will accidentally rip her stitches. Her temporary kennel will be near the back door, but there's about a 2"" step down from the house to the porch, and another 4"" step down to the grass. Should I have her use puppy pads in the temporary kennel in lieu of bringing her outside to pee? I can lift her out if necessary, but she's a much lankier puppy than Seven was, so I'm not super confident that I can carry her without touching/stretching the incision. Would it likely set back her bathroom training significantly if it's only for a few days? 

If any of you have relevant stories, please feel free to share any tips or anything you wish you'd known ahead of time! I believe I've got the rest of my bases covered, but it wouldn't hurt to check if there's anything I've missed. I'm sure things will probably go fine, but I'd rather be overly prepared. 

I've asked the vet for advice, but I'm hoping to get some anecdotal advice as well. The vet seconded our plan for keeping them separated while unsupervised for a few days, but wasn't sure about the bathroom situation (first tripawd dog as a patient).

DogCare,a43691,Capelily,1,Two dogs and dog walking guilt,"I have two dogs. One is 14yo, small Jack Russell/Shih Tzu mix. The other is my rescue from the American South--she's got some pitty and boxer in her, 4yo. She weighs about 50-55 lbs.

Backstory: It's been a rough year for me, and I've fallen off walking the dogs on any schedule. I have a large fenced-in back yard, so they do get to romp around. I used to walk them together off leash. I can't keep the larger one off leash anymore. One day while we were walking she protected me from a young guy who was scared of her and used a large branch to keep her away from him, which made her more alarmed. When he started walking in my direction on the path, she bit him in the leg. So she obviously needs more work on fear aggression--I know this.

Anyway, I can't walk them together on leashes. I could walk with both of them, but with one on leash and one off leash. The other alternative is to walk them both separately. My dilemma is that if I do walk them separately, what do I do about the jealousy and dismay being projected from the one who's left behind? I'm confounded.",7,1544210883

DogCare,a1i3mq,WalleStark,1,Reasons why male and female German Shepherds would fight? What to do now?,"Context: They're five years and six months old, and have been raised together their entire life. They're not spayed or neutered (neither is common practice in Egypt), but she hasn't been pregnant ever despite having sex. This strongly suggests infertility of either or both, and the fact that the male had a minor surgery on his penis when he was around a year old further suggests his infertility. Onto the actual fight. 

They fought for the first time exactly a week ago (Thursday), and each had a few cuts. It was broken up relatively quickly and our vet prescribed medicine for the injuries. We separated them from each other, for 24 hours until we brought them together and felt like they were in good terms. In hindsight, this was a big mistake on our part. 

The following Sunday when I was giving them their medicine and applying the creams / sprays on their cuts, they got into another fight, a bigger one, and I got bitten in my arm semi severely trying to break up the fight.

They have been currently separated since. Unfortunately because of my household, they have to be chained because we don't have two different locations to keep each in. They were walked separately on Monday and Wednesday, and walked together on Tuesday. They didn't show any signs of violence on that walk, but I'm afraid that if I let them loose they'll get into an even bigger fight. At the same time, I don't want to keep them tied up. 

There is a dog trainer coming to them on Sunday, which is the earliest we could find, but three more days is a long time. 

This brings me to my main question and sub questions? What are possible reasons they could have fought? Someone suggested that he might have had a high sex drive and that she was on her period. I noticed that they fought while I or my brother were there inside the garden playing with them / treating them, so I thought it may be jealousy, but two instances are definitely not enough to judge.

I'm currently on my way home to give them a walk together. I was planning on assessing the tension between them and deciding whether to let them loose or not. I want to let them loose, but I'm afraid of another fight. ",4,1543504012

My mother takes him to obedience classes every week and this past week the trainer there said she should get him off of Puppy food because that is what is causing stiffness in his hind-quarters. She says feeding him regular dog food would fix or lessen the stiffness. Now what I don't understand is the fact that puppies need the extra calories in puppy food as well as the nutrients so that their bones grow properly. What I need help with is understanding where the trainer is coming from and to gain some understanding in full about how to help this puppy.

She's gotten the same food for at least 4-5 years now.

About 3-4 days ago, I noticed she hadn't eaten the food I had fed her in the morning and it was still there come dinner time.  It's fairly normal for her to not eat right away as soon as i put the food in her dish.  She might come by an hour or two later and eat it.  I let it go until the next morning.  She still hadn't eaten.  I tried tossing it and giving her a fresh bowl. She still hasn't eaten any of it.  I took her to the vet and they could find nothing wrong with her.

The thing is, she will still eat a treat if I give it to her.

Also, he chewed a cord up and scratched up my bedroom door on both sides. Therefore, I'm looking for some type of relatively inexpensive dog gazebo or play pen he can't get out of for when nobody is home. I have a tile entranceway I'd like to place this on.

DogCare,9kasiw,pas0003,2,Dog attacked another dog,"Hi all,

We've got a 2 year old female Staffy cross that we adopted a year ago. Lots of separation anxiety, no toilet training, generally very badly behaved dog initially. We worked through a lot of those issues within the lady year and she is more or less a well behaved dog now.

My parents have an 8 year old staffy purebred, female. She's a wonderful dog. We have introduced them initially and drop by every month or so, so they get a chance to play and enjoy each other's company. Normally they are both super happy to see each other and if anything, it's my parents dog that's a bit jealous of my dog in terms of attention.

Around 2 months ago my dog bit my parents dog after play fighting, nothing major, but mum had to separate them. I wasn't there to see it. That put us on a bit of alert. Fast forward to yesterday. After both having breakfast, my parents dog went to check the bowl of my dog after they both finished eating, which with no warning latched on to my parents dog neck and wouldn't let go. Apparently it took them a minute or two to get my dog off, while parents dog was squealing in pain, by blocking its nose. Parents dog had a bit tear in its neck and was blessing quite a bit. 

We have never had that with any other dogs we had are now scared of this situation occurring again. The thing that worries us the most is the lack of warning - growling or such, and the lack of letting go. My parents dog could have died if parents weren't there to separate them. There was never any aggression to humans and I do train it to be okay with my hands, etc around it's dog bowl when it eats. Never any issues. However the fact that we can't leave them together is a deal breaker as we often travel. We are also thinking of having children in not too distant future and this makes us fearful of having such a dog in the household.

But now that school is starting, we need someone to come in during the day to take her out to pee. She's 8 months old and fairly small, so she can't hold it. We literally just need someone to come in once in the middle of the day and take her out for about 5 minutes so she can do her business; she gets plenty of exercise once my sister comes home from school. However, all of the dogwalkers we've contacted are pretty expensive. The cheapest offer was $15 per day. That's literally $15 to take our dog out for five minutes. That's $75/week for less than half an hour of work. Right now we're doing that but we're looking for other options. Anybody know any way to find an affordable dogwalker (I'm using that term but we really just need someone to take her out)! Thank you!

After she came back from the vet she had been on a drip and was given something for nausea, she was more herself but now a few days later it's pretty bad. She's going back to the vet today and will hopefully be put on another drip and given the proper medicine she needs to get better. But my question is what can be done at home when she gets back? this is my girlfriends dog. Her mother seems to be in the mindset that maybe putting her down might be best but all they've been doing is filling up her water bowl and trying to feed her what they normally would (cheese, bacon, etc) but myself and my girlfriend feel that if she's just properly cared for then she will get better...

DogCare,95848q,Huwe,10,Arthritis food,"Howdy

My 11-year-old Shepherd-Malamute cross is slowly starting to show signs of his age. The vet says he's in tip top health but for mild arthritis on his back legs. They have provided me with some fish oil and a powder to add into dinner to help with the condition, and I've been mixing in a whole sweet potato with each meal since. The good news is he's not having any problems eating it all (though he's never been one to turn down a meal).

I've read things like ginger and turmeric can also help and I'm willing to give that a go. My main question is: can I over-do the health food? I want to help as much as I can, but I'm concerned there may be some negative results if I'm adding too much into the meal in the way of fresh food.

Is this worth worrying about?

DogCare,90znpu,reeper_bahn,3,Newly adopted dog won‚Äôt eat dog food,"So the basics, I‚Äôve adopted a German Shepherd, 1 year old, from a shelter he was only at for a few days. His previous owner/s surrendered him claiming they didn‚Äôt know he was going to get too big for their apartment (...uhhh). As far as I can tell he isn‚Äôt traumatized or anything, so I don‚Äôt think they were abusing him, but he‚Äôs had some weird difficulties adjusting since I brought him home on Wednesday. He got fixed either that morning or the night before so some of it makes sense, and Temperament and behavior wise he‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs mostly just that a) it took him a couple days before he would drink water voluntarily out of his own dish (brought him with me to therapy because he‚Äôs going to be my ESA and he drank out of the water bowls for the therapists‚Äô dogs there with no problem but at home? He wouldn‚Äôt do it until yesterday), and b) he still won‚Äôt eat his dog food unless I feed it to him out of my hand, which I‚Äôve buckled and done a few times because he hasn‚Äôt eaten nearly enough in the last couple days and I‚Äôm worried. He doesn‚Äôt seem to dislike the food I‚Äôve gotten in particular because he *will* eat it ravenously if it‚Äôs in my hands, and he begs for people food any time my boyfriend and I sit down to eat, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his appetite. My best guess is that his previous owners fed him mostly or even only table scraps, which is a problem - I have no intention to do that. 
I‚Äôm giving him the chicken and pumpkin flavor of nature‚Äôs recipe grain free dry food, if that helps to know. I did try adding some water to it and he actually took a couple small bites out of the dish at first but then kept refusing it until I put some in my hand again. I have never had a dog before, only a couple puppies for very short amounts of time when I was a kid and besides that have only had cats around, so I don‚Äôt know my way around dog behavior very well. Is there an obvious reason he‚Äôs doing this? Should I try different dishes maybe, or wet food, or maybe mix wet and dry food for him? I‚Äôm at a loss, he‚Äôs still only eating the amount of food they instructed me to give him for post-surgery -once a day-, so he‚Äôs had maybe a cup and a half of food in him per day since Wednesday. I am going to call the shelter tomorrow and ask about their feeding schedule and all that, but they did only have him for three or four days so it‚Äôs hard to say if they‚Äôll be able to help me. I‚Äôm also going to spend some of tomorrow searching for a vet for him who might be able to help, but if this is an issue I can find a solution for on my own and in less time, that‚Äôs preferred of course.

The problem is, he has got a sister. I know that this kind of mange is not contagious, but that's not the issue.
The issue is that they're extremely hyperactive, and it's genuinely impossible for a single person to walk both of them together. I do this with my brother. Now my brother is off to travel tomorrow (no way that he can cancel it), and I'll be with them on my own for around 12 days.

I'll do my absolute best to find a walking and showering partner so that I can treat the dog, but if that is not possible, can I do anything to at least prevent the Mange from developing. Like the medicine bath will start the recovery, but if that is not doable, can I at least stop the condition from growing? Pause it until it's possible to carry out the vet's instructions?

DogCare,8uz9p8,cloverwitch,3,How to exercise a dog that doesn't like toys?,"First off, an important sidenote is that I am disabled and cannot go for long walks/runs. My limit on exercise is unfortunately expended on my job.

I have a female 7yo lab mix rescue. She's about 10lbs overweight. I've reduced her food intake, and supplemented some of that with raw veggies (she loves veggies, especially carrots). I cannot give her enough exercise. She's not destructive in any way, but she does seem pretty bored throughout the day, and it would help her lose weight. 

I've tried every toy possible, I've tried bribing her with treats, and tried training her to fetch, but all to no avail. She just has absolutely no interest in it. And when she does get hyped up enough to chase after it, she runs halfway and turns back around. 

I've tried taking her to dog parks, but she doesn't have much interest in other dogs and either sniffs around a bit, or just lays next to me. The closest I've gotten to getting her to play with a toy is her rolling around her treat ball that i feed her from. I've even tried using that to play fetch but she quickly gets bored of it once she realizes I'm not going to feed her (the treats aren't enough).

I'm really not sure where to go from here. Any help would be so very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.

DogCare,8t1gvp,senirambus,5,Wart surgery advice,"So my 3 year old miniature Jack Russell has a relatively large wart just behind her right shoulder blade.
Our vet has reassured us it‚Äôs benign and surgery to remove it would be unnecessarily risky, however it is very sensitive and due to its location often gets touched while we‚Äôre petting her and unfortunately sits directly under her Halti harness, which is a necessity while on walks.
Our vet gave us a topical steroid cream to try which had no noticeable effect and advised we shave around it to allow as much sunlight to reach the wart as possible, which also hasn‚Äôt helped.

So I basically want your input as to whether to get the surgery to remove it, or if you have any alternatives to suggest. I‚Äôm leaning towards getting it at the moment, as her teeth could also benefit from a thorough cleaning and they can do that while she‚Äôs anaesthetised.
I‚Äôm just wary of the surgery not being strictly necessary and that she could develop more warts in the future, surgical removal can‚Äôt become a regular thing.",4,1529675355

DogCare,8rzzzl,CommanderAze,5,5 month old puppy regressing or having medical issue?,"Ok so I have a 5 month old Bernese Mountain Dog, hes been super easy going and easy to train for potty training as well as a number of tricks. He went for about a month and a half with no accidents in the house until recently. He has not been neutered yet but will be soon. 

**Some factors to consider**

He isn't outside for long maybe 30 minutes at the most when we go for walks a few times a day and his daycare is indoors with good quality AC. I don't take him outside during peak hours for the sun and try and walk him when its cooler in the morning and evening. (having a black coat he heats up quickly) He is taken out regularly once in the morning after eating, is in an open play area at day care during the weekdays with an area to eliminate, and he generally pees just after we leave the daycare, then I take him out as needed when he signals at the door. 

**The problem**

Recently he has shown signs of regressing in his training, ignoring commands or just trying to do his own thing. This in itself isn't that big a deal but insert the factor of him drinking a lot more water than normal and having to pee much more frequently. Talking larger volumes every hour. I noticed this, and his daycare mentioned it to me as well that he was drinking and peeing a some what alarming amount. He will signal at the door to go out every hour and have to go, but can sleep 10 hours all night (groans if you wake him and isn't in a hurry to pee in the morning) 

**The Vet**

I took him into the Vet and had him checked out with a Urinalysis only to find nothing wrong. The doctor mentioned it could be a short phase of regression or it might be that he is trying to supplement being hungry for extra water.  He is slightly underweight but undergoing a growth spurt so he is now (after these events started) now eating more than normal to help bulk him up (Blue Buffalo Chicken and rice for a Puppy)

What am I missing, what should I be looking for? *Is this just a standard regression in training?*

lastly been playing with the idea of having him spend less time at daycare so he has to hold it for longer during the day. As at daycare he can relieve himself any time he needs to with the exception of lunch time where he is crated and fed, and has the last week at least had a tendency to pee in his crate during lunch. He is really well socialized with large and small dogs, as well as people so some time alone in the apartment isn't likely going to be an issue. ",4,1529332719

DogCare,8ruuxi,Noodle36,0,Two parents working full-time. Would we be leaving a dog alone too much of the time?,"I've been wanting to get a dog for a long time for my kids (7 and 2). I had a dog growing up and have always loved them, but my wife never had a dog growing up and is not really a dog person - she can enjoy their company but she's pretty scared of them - but she wants the kids to have one.

Her concern, though, is that she's worried it's cruel for a dog to be home alone while we're working, and I'm having trouble thinking my way around how much it's reasonable to leave a dog alone so I wanted to get people's thoughts.

This potential dog would be at home from when my wife leaves with the kids in the morning - 8:30ish - until I get home in the afternoon - 4:10 on the early side and 4:50ish on later days. This would be four days a week, because on Monday my mother-in-law is at our place with my 2-year-old. She's not a dog person either though, so I wouldn't ask her to walk the dog or do anything more than the minimum.

We'd be walking the dog on weekends and at least a couple of times during the week, and obviously playing with it every evening. It'd have the run of our [small,sheltered back yard](https://imgur.com/0NjdOx9) (about 60 square metres) while alone, with a kennel on the back verandah, and I expect eventually the run of the downstairs of the house as well. We're living south of Sydney, so lows in winter of like 7 celsius and highs in summer in the low 40s.

We potty-trained him in a certain place in our house and he's always done his business there. However, starting two years ago, he would pee in random places around the house.

I'm not sure what is causing this. We did a  urine culture and sensitivity test for him and he didn't have any urinary tract infections so this is not the reason. I'm suspecting it could be terreritorial issues since he is un-neutered but at this old age, why is he showing territorial behavior now? I appreciate your help in advance.

I live in the city, but recently bought an RV so I'll be taking Bob all over North America.  I opted to get the vaccine, and they gave it to him.  About 20 minutes after we got home the vet called me.   
 They told me my dog might have tested positive for Lyme disease, they said ""it was a little shady, but not certain.""  They said they would retest him when he came in for the booster. 

Last week I went back for the booster.  They gave him the booster and tested for Lyme again.  This time they showed me a test strip that looked EXTREMELY positive.  The vet almost seemed giddy about it, which seemed odd.

My dog walks up to 10 miles per day with me and has no symptoms of Lyme disease.  I told my vet that I would get a second opinion.  She got very angry.    Later in the week I got a certified letter from the vet telling me not to come back.  The letter was rambling, filling an entire page, and made no mention of their Lyme disease diagnosis.

I made another appointment with a different vet to try to figure out whether my dog has Lyme disease or not.  A friend, who runs a dog rescue program, told me that my vet did not do my dog's Lyme vaccination and testing in the proper order.  She said every dog will test positive after the vaccination.  She also told me the vet I was going to does not have a good reputation.

We‚Äôve been to the vet a couple times. About three weeks ago she had a urine extraction done and they said she had a UTI. We gave her Clavamox for 2 weeks and then did the test again. This time the vet said he wants to try her on either Proin or estrogen to see how she responds to it. Before I start giving her medication (that she would need for the rest of her life...) I wanted to get a second opinion from another vet and possibly see if anyone else here has gone through the same thing?

She doesn‚Äôt have any other signs of illness (no fever, normal thirst and appetite, she doesn‚Äôt pee in the house or struggle to pee outside...no blood or allergy symptoms) she just... spots. We‚Äôve been calling it a ‚Äúsploot.‚Äù

She‚Äôs such a great dog, mostly well behaved, smart, and easy to train. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing the right things for her. Her diet consists of Nutrisource Pure Vita grain-free kibble and she gets a few other grain free treats when doing training. 

Any thoughts? ",9,1527655097

DogCare,8mcdbm,Boneyabba,0,Can anyone help me estimate these costs? (100lb mastif female- 4years- spayed late in life after multiple litters),"Treatment Options
So now you‚Äôve taken your dog to your veterinarian and have received the diagnosis of urethral sphincter hypotonus. What can be done about it? There are options for dealing with or treating this problem. They include:

Prescription drugs that affect the sphincter muscle and help to tone it
Surgery to correct an ectopic ureter (when the tubes that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder end in the wrong spot within the body)
Collagen injections into the urethra
Of these options, drugs are the first choice for treatment, with surgery and injections reserved for those dogs who have not responded well to their medications.

Medication Options
Two medications are most commonly used to treat urinary incontinence. They are:

Diethylstilbestrol (DES), an estrogen, is given once to several times a week. Some dogs cannot tolerate it as they will begin to show signs of being in heat while they are taking the drug. There is also the possibility of bone marrow toxicity if the dose is not monitored carefully. It is important that blood work be checked periodically when using this drug. This drug is only available through compounding pharmacies and is not an FDA-approved treatment.
Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride (PPA) is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to urethral sphincter hypotonus. Up until recently, one could only get PPA through compounding pharmacies. Now there is PROIN¬Æ. PROIN¬Æ is the only FDA-approved PPA product available to treat urinary incontinence in dogs due to urethral sphincter hypotonus. It comes in a liver-flavored, chewable tablet that is available in 3 strengths. It contains no beef or beef by-products, which is good for food-allergic dogs. Dogs also like the taste, with the majority of dogs willing to eat the pill by itself or when placed in their food. The pills are easily given once in the morning and once at night. It is important to recognize that effects of PPA are not immediate and that it may take several days before the full effects of PROIN¬Æ are seen and you notice an improvement in your dog‚Äôs incontinence. PROIN¬Æmust be given every day for continued effect. In the 180 day field study to test effectiveness, PROIN¬Æ was well-tolerated by dogs and over 90% of dog owners were satisfied with the results.",8,1527362181

He was left behind when his owner got evicted. He is absolute joy. Very intelligent, caring, calm, cute‚Äìcomplete package. He learned basic commands such as sit, stay, come/go. He even got used to riding on the back of my ATV and walking/coming back on ling hikes (unless he sees a deer). Anyways, we try to take him anywhere with us (hotel stays, vacations, etc) and always walk him both on the leash or ling hikes. I am talking about hours long hikes 20-30 miles, especially when on ATV. He is not kenneled and simply an awesome pet. The problem: if someone comes over, he tends to bite/nip. Not always, but certain people. Maintenance guy came in and he nipped him. When my son has friends over (7 y/o) we just to afraid to let him run free. Today my friend came in, who is a big, muscular, dude and they met before and it was fine. Today he nipped him, and harder than time before. This is 3-4th time he has done this to various people. My wife is to the point where she wants to put him back in the shelter. We all love him. He is great with my son and wife. He is fine outside when running free‚Äìno regard to people or other dogs. He is great in the dog parks and walks away from trouble. He is, however, very protective when at home and home only. May be his previous owners taught him to protect, may be he is protective of his herd (us), but we are afraid as he is a ticking bomb. Again, he is well-exercised, loved,  and cared for, but this one problem. Could someone please suggest what can be done? How can it be done? How to behave and insure this does not happen again. I‚Äôd hate to see him go, but I am having a hard time protecting him from my spouse. He knows what he did wrong, as he avoids eye contact with me and spend all day outside today.

DogCare,8krwl9,Cererna,3,Thoughts on orthopedic dog beds?,"I'm in Australia and there seems to be a lack of ""affordable"" orthopedic dog beds on the market. I say affordable in quotes because they're known to be more expensive than your regular dog bed. Then again, for me, if it's a buy it once thing then I don't mind spending just a bit extra (within reason).

So from what I've researched, a proper orthopedic dog bed needs to have memory foam with a supporting layer below to avoid pressure points if the foam touches the floor. That already reduced the options to a couple. I have found:

* [Topdog Comfit orthopedic dog bed $282](https://www.topdogcomfit.com.au/product-large-topdog-comfit-orthopedic-dog-bed-9.aspx)

* [Big Paws Orthopedic dog bed cushion bolster $240](https://www.crazysales.com.au/online-big-paws-memory-foam-extra-large-dog-bed-orthopedic-dog-beds-cushion-bolster-brown-133179.html) or a $200 dual layer one (instead of 3 layers)

Any thoughts on these? He currently only has a raised bed and no indoor bed along with being about 8 years old, the vet said he might come into some muscle/bone pain.

DogCare,8kr07z,CodeSpent,0,1-3 year yeast infection in 2 dogs,"Hi, my roommate has 2 dogs, a little Beagle  Ally, and Mia a Boxer/Pit. I moved back in with my roommate about a year ago, and the old place we were at was disgusting so finally got sick of it enough to just pull the trigger on finding a new place.

For the 8 months at the old place, he'd blame the dogs constantly scratching and chewing themselves bloody on allergies to dust ..though never did anything about it, he's a man of tons of excuses. Now it's been about 4 months at the new place and I bathe them often and keep the house clean and there are no improvements.

I've started researching and have been picking little things up to help soothe them, but nothing is working. They smell, very quickly after getting a bath, losing hair, Ally chews her backside to the point of bleeding (he calls it just a hotspot that Beagles get but that's a copout I think), chewing their paws, shaking their heads constantly, and shedding bad. 

Mia has grey spots on her ear that look awful. Claims it's just scabbing, but scabs heal, it's been a year.

I don't drive, so I can't sneak them to the vet, and I can't get him to accept that it's time to take them to the damn vet so they're not miserable, but he won't.

My research leads me to believe this is a yeast infection, and all sources say it should be caught early. So posting here to see if anyone has any advice for approaching such a lengthy infection possibly without a vet visit?

About a week ago, we adopted an owner-surrendered 6-year-old terrier mix from our local shelter. Needless to say, this little dude has had a LOT of changes in his life ‚Äî slowly having his kibble switched, being groomed for maybe the first time ever, not being neglected, etc.

That being said, he's been itching quite a bit and we're starting to get worried. He has no hair loss, but if you part the fur there are pinkish-red splotches on the skin. Problem is, I can't tell if the splotches are from the itching or if the itching is from the splotches. I suspect it might be a food allergy or residual flea itchies. He just got washed with a soothing aloe shampoo on Saturday, and part of me is just wondering if his skin is just not used to having the natural oils stripped away.

We have a vet visit scheduled for this weekend, but I was hoping someone might have some advice on short-term solutions to make dude more comfortable until then! I've read about the benefits of adding oil to his diet but that must be done gradually, and I'm worried applying a coconut oil directly to the spots might incentivize him to lick them more.

He's very tolerant of letting me look at it, and brushing the spots seems to be soothing. I obviously can't brush him constantly until his vet appointment, so any advice is welcome!",14,1526313029

DogCare,8huchs,lordroy,4,"While playing one day, roommate's dog had seizure... what possible causes??? (details in comments)","So my roommate has a 9-ish month female old pit/lab mix who is getting HUGE and strong.  Once a night I go out with both of them to play, usually with this home-made tug toy of my fashioning (rubber core, covered in old socks, tied to paracord, with a nice handle, etc).   One night, after a LOT of play and tugging, the dog (Luci) started having problems maintaining balance, then ran in circles for about a minute, fell over, and had a full on seizure (legs sticking straight out, eyes rolled back... etc). All in all the episode lasted maybe 90-120 seconds.  We calmed her down, and she seemed fine after that, no issues.   We kept her calm and gave her plenty of water to drink and kept her cool (it was a fairly cool night).

After that scare, we did a bunch of research online and also contacted a vet friend for advice.   Vet friend just basically told us it can be common, to watch to see if it happened again.   We were trying to come up with WHY it happened tho... and it came down to a few things.

A couple months ago, the dog (and owner) were struck by a vehicle... nothing broken but bounced around a bit.   Dog was in the vet while the owner was in the hospital, and both were released in good health... however it is suspected (now) that maybe Luci might have had some brain damage (maybe) which caused the seizure.

Another thing that might have caused it was she chewed up 2 dozen ""gel pens"" one night while the owner was at work, eating most of the gel inside of them.   We feared that maybe that the gel was toxic and might have poisoned her to cause the seizure.

We also noticed tonight, when she would be pulling hard against a braced tug (where she could NOT move the other side) that she seemed to tire herself out and get wobbly legs &amp; losing balance, and we fear that the hard tugging is causing some sort of extreme pressure on her skull and/or rattling her brain in her head causing the seizure.

She is a super rambunctious dog, with seemingly limitless energy, so we are trying to find the common cause of the issue.   Any other suggestions would be great.

Long story short, I'm going to be taking in a dog of a friend's because said friend hasn't been in the best shape and hasn't been able to properly take care of their dog. However, I have no idea where to start. 

The dog is a 5 year old golden lab. Afaik, he gets baths a fair amount so that's not really an issue. But,

1. He desperately needs his claws trimmed (I would do it myself but he's squirmy and I'm not that strong)

2. He's very big. They feed him a good amount now but before they used to overfeed him, and coupled with the fact that he didn't get tons of exercise, I think it was all just adding up. That being said:

3. He doesn't get tons of exercise. They play fetch in the yard sometimes, but they haven't been on a proper walk in quite a long time. I've wanted to take him on walks myself, but what I'm worried about is his socialization. He's not used to being around other dogs anymore, and I'm scared about what would happen in a worst case scenario. In addition, he probably doesn't remember how to act when he takes a walk, does he? They trained him not to pull on the leash, not to rush across intersections, etc. but I'm not sure if he still knows how to do that stuff.

I'm also just worried about the financial cost of taking care of him. I'm a college student who doesn't work at the moment, but I've put aside a set amount of money that could go towards the dog.

Any help would be appreciated! I apologize if some of this is common sense stuff, I've only ever owned one dog before who was relatively low-maintenance so I don't have tons of experience. Thanks in advance.",7,1525274080

We couldn't take care of all of them so we gave away four, and the two remaining puppies stayed with us, they're named Finch and Oreo (both males).

Finch seemed to be the closest one to their mother, because when we tried to give him away, their mother whined a lot and seemed to be really upset. They slept together all the time and Finch stayed beside her most of the time. She wasn't this close with Oreo (at least from what we could see).

A week ago, Oreo got sick and refused to eat (very lethargic), but he eventually got back on his feet after days of forcefeeding and making sure he stayed hydrated (we had no access to veterinary care, and this was all we could do for him). A day after Oreo went back to his usual self, Finch got sick too. He was so lethargic and refused to eat, and sadly forcefeeding didn't work on him because unlike Oreo, who was somehow cooperative with the forcefeeding, Finch got annoyed whenever we forcefed him and he refused to drink water or interact with us.

We had some hope that he would go back to his usual self just like Oreo did, but sadly, just 5 hours ago, we found him dead beside his mother and brother. I'm not really sure if I find it comforting that they were together when he died. Aaaaaaa the grief and loss is still so fresh it's so heavy :(

Anyway, the rest of the dogs are grieving in their own ways. Oreo is just quiet in one corner, weakly wagging his tail whenever I try to interact with him. However, their mother is more aggressive and growling at anyone who comes near, I almost feel like she's so hurt and frustrated that we were able to save Oreo but couldn't save her favorite son.

I want to know what I can do to ease their grief, especially the mother's :( I love them so much and I want to comfort them, I feel like Chuchay's grief is way deeper and more painful than what I can ever feel. It hurts me so much to see them like this. What can I do to ease their pain? :(

Looking for some help. We adopted our pup about seven months ago. He was a rescue dog who appears to be kept inside without much walking/exercise.  However, we are pretty active family now take him on long hikes, fishing, swimming, etc. At first it seemed like his paws were just not used to outside terrain and were soft. Overtime everything seemed to normalize and he loves outdoors. Yesterday I noticed a slight limp and decided to check his dog feet. It appears his paws are peeling to the point where old skin came off with new growing right under old. https://imgur.com/gallery/vFIKFkr

He licks it and rips the remaining skit off where sometimes it slightly bleeds. It almost appears like a chemical burn like when I work on the car and my skins starts to peels off. I did some research and some suggest it might be food allergy, seasonal allergy, fungus, stress, etc. but what is it really? How can I help him? The food has not changed (he eats dry gluten free) and everything that we eat and always was fine. We live in Arizona where it‚Äôs starting to get hot. We did change our floor cleaning solution and other day had to leave him home alone overnight (under neighbors supervision). He did not eat or drink while we were gone (stress). Could this be seasonal or something that we should be concerned with? Overall he looks and acts healthy. Thank you. ",5,1524337370

We got him when we were in Canada when he was a puppy and he has grown with the family but we have since moved to Peru he is happy here but it is not the same as being in Canada and going to our Cottage every summer. We are going to be going back to Canada in July to spend about a month at our Cottage and I know he would love to be there and swim and everything my question is should I be flying him back and forth? After the first trip I sort of thought I wouldn't take him in the plane anymore because it really is kind of exhausting and he's so thirsty after the flight. But now that I'm thinking of going back and I'm thinking of how much he would love it I have to weigh the option of bringing him back and forth on the plane or keeping him here because he's getting old he's quite healthy so I am not sure what to do. Any advice? The flight is about 8 to 10 hours but it often grows into more time because of the waiting between connections,1,1523802297

I'm okay with letting him sleep on my bed every night but my mom doesn't agree and tells me to tie him to the foot of the bed with his leash so he can sleep on his own bed. My mom is just against him sleeping with me, and she also thinks he'll mess up my sleep because he wakes up often in the night (which is true.) We don't have a crate for him since he usually sleeps in the bed with my aunt. The leash is a good length where he can sleep comfortably on his bed and reach his food and water.

Edit - It's worth noting my dog loves to dig in her bed (not the one in the crate).  I have a cheap foam bed and her digging has resulting in the inner liner being torn to shreds, so the bed won't hold it's shape anymore and now she gets little support from it.

He is very active, but, because of his deafness, I've been wary letting him out in my backyard unleashed.

As a supplement to regular walks, and exercise before I take the pup outside to go potty, would it make sense to let him use a treadmill?

Our new (12-week-old) Aussie/husky mix puppy is the greatest thing in the world. She had her first bath today, and I noticed that the slight yellowing that's shown up on some of the white areas of her coat, mainly on the back of her legs and on her lower sides, wasn't lessened or removed by the bath, which makes me think it's not dirt but some sort of staining? It's not a huge deal, and she's super healthy (saw the vet just today for vaccinations/check-up), but I've only ever owned black dogs so I'm not sure how normal this is, or how fixable it is. So:
- what might this yellowing be from? While she's still getting the hang of the whole potty training thing, I don't *think* she's so incompetent that she manage to get pee all over her often enough to stain...
- is this yellowing something that can be changed, or do all dogs with white areas have this going on and I've just never noticed?
- I know they make whitening shampoos for white dogs, but (dumb question, I'm sure) can I use a whitening shampoo on my black/white/brown dog? Should I only use it on her white parts? Only the stained parts? Or all over like regular shampoo?
- at what age would it be safe to use a whitening shampoo on her?
- do you have a whitening shampoo that you would recommend? Or are they all bogus or (worse!) unsafe?

(Sorry if these are super doofy questions! The world of aussie/husky grooming is brand new to me, since my black lab mix is pretty much at a ""wash when stinky"" kind of maintenance/grooming level. :p )",4,1520981402

I always wanted to have a playful but calm, middle to big sized dog.
I'd rather get a race like a Husky, Border Colie or Labrador... but Husky is out of option because of the weather.
My partner want to adopt a stray dog, and i'm cool with the concept.
My problem is that, i REALLY don't want small dogs (which is all i see for adoption).

And most important, i'm not sure if i'll be able to know the personality of the dog... adopting a dog and then abandoning it soon after is not an option, soo i'm really afraid of the pup having the personality of Satan incarnate.

When we took her to the vet last Wednesday (2/28), he prescribed doxycycline for kennel cough. Although her coughing fits have decreased, she is breathing with enough mucus in her upper respiratory tract that you can hear it. In the past few days, she has developed a runny nose that is exacerbated by going on  a walk. See photos attached. I am wondering if this is normal for a dog with kennel cough or should we be suspecting something else. We have though that she could have allergies (her eyes are often productive as well). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

We currently have my parent‚Äôs old Great Dane crate. It is huge, it held a 200+ lb Great Dane with room for him to turn around, sit, lie down, all that jazz. 

Our current dog is 65 lbs. he barely takes up any room in the crate, but it is his crate. My husband is convinced we can just get a second dog (most likely a very young do/possibly a puppy and definitely female) and they can both use the same crate.

I feel like this is a bad idea but am having a hard time articulating why. Am I right that this wouldn‚Äôt work? My idea was to sell the current giant crate and get two crates that are the appropriate size for each dog. It would involve rearranging our apartment, but I feel like it would be better for both dogs.

My current dog loves everyone, especially puppies, I just feel like having them in the same crate could breed trouble.

We have four pets, but three of them are completely fine without us at home. What I'm asking about is our fourth pet, a 1-year-old dog (I believe she's a black lab). She is ***very*** high-energy. When you leave her for more than 10 minutes and then come back, she will actively jump on top of you and playfully nibble at your hands. She also gets very distressed whenever she's left alone for an extended period of time. In fact, she's broken or chewed up a lot of things of ours when she was left home alone for a few hours. Some of these items include the power cable to our cable box, multiple pillows, and even her own cage. 

Which brings me to my next point: my mother has resorted to getting her a cage (about 1.5 by 0.75 meters), putting the cage in our garage, and leaving her in there for the day. The worst parts are, she only gets a water bowl, the lights in the garage are shut off entirely when we aren't home, and during the cold days, she doesn't even get a blanket or anything. 

I absolutely hate having her in there, especially for so long, but I can't really do much. I've let her out and let her stay with me in my room during the days I was the only one at home, but always kept freaking out and jumping all over me, even when I needed her not to. I don't want her in there like that, but I physically can't have her in the main house. The hard part for me is when I keep her in there when I'm home, I can hear her barking and crying for at least an hour or two. It breaks my heart. I'm just looking for advice on some sort of solution I can come to to at least not have her in such misery.",20,1519959361

I was hoping someone could help me because just today my dog has been acting really strangely in that she has ran around the house all day with her tail down basically non-stop and has been going in places she never usually goes (for example she decided to climb inside my wardrobe, settled down to sleep there and then got up and ran off like 5 seconds later).

Its like she's constantly really restless and almost in pain but I don't know what she could be in pain from.

He‚Äôs 2 years old, I‚Äôve had him since he was 8 weeks. He‚Äôs a smart, energetic, cuddle bug. I‚Äôve had his on blue wilderness grain free chicken. Everything we give him is human grade treats and we limit toys that are made outside of the US and if we don‚Äôt know what is in them.

When he was 3 months old we were told he has minor allergies - red eyes, congested breathing - and he is on Allegra daily.

In 2 years we have had 3 major bouts of illness - first were anal cysts which lead to horrible diarrhea as he was on antibiotics. About 9  months later, another bout of horrible diarrhea- lasted 2 months. The vet said there was nothing we can do but wait it out. Now it‚Äôs happening again.

A month ago he did damage to the soft tissue of his paw. He had a terrible reaction to an anti inflammatory medicine and his urethra closed up. He had to be catheterized twice. Now we are back to horrible diarrhea. He‚Äôs spent more time on a chicken and rice diet than any actual food. That was a month ago. 

Today I noticed that he has raw skin around his lower lip. I would say it looks like a hot spot, but how do you get a hot spot on your lip? I am freaking out because the vet seems to think that we need to treat each problem as they arise, but I feel like it all has to be connected in some way. He‚Äôs a young dog - we can‚Äôt afford to keep having thousands in vet bills all the time. And I just want him to be happy and healthy. 

Has anyone had issues like this? Does anyone have advice? All I want is for my pup to be healthy. Any advice is welcome.

By 9 am we left with an all but confirmed Multiple Myeloma diagnosis. The emergency vet alluded to the fact that the symptoms he was having meant it had already spread.

First time dog owner here. We just adopted a 3 year old mix (they didn‚Äôt know specifics) from our local shelter only yesterday, Saturday morning. I have two major questions.  

The first is very concerning for us. Today when petting the dog we found a cluster of what looks similar to caviar in an area that‚Äôs smaller than a dime‚Äôs. It‚Äôs rooted at the base of the dog‚Äôs fur, so now we‚Äôre freaking out because it could be fleas or lice, from what we think. We washed everything that he‚Äôs touched and we are still really scared of contracting the fleas/lice! Any advice? We‚Äôre taking him to the vet tomorrow. We would have bathed him but the shelter said he had surgery recently and has water dissolving stitches, so no water baths for 2 weeks! Ah!!! I really don‚Äôt know what to do and could use some help.  

Next, we have the issue of potty training. The dog has been in two shelters during its life, and presumably somewhere else before then? But even at 3 years old it‚Äôs not potty trained! We‚Äôve tried taking it outside but it‚Äôs been very cold recently and because we live next to a street there are a lot of loud noises. Our dog is also very very shy and needs constant human presence. We‚Äôve also tried newspaper and absorbent ‚Äúpuppy pads‚Äù. So far the dog had peed on the newspaper once, hardware floor twice, and pooped on a rug... :( Tips on how to potty train? I should also mention that he has a gum disease and teeth removed so he won‚Äôt eat hard food often.  

That being said I‚Äôd really appreciate any other tips that you could give.

DogCare,7yeafe,trwy012,8,My dog suddently paralyzed,"I am really desperate. 
My beloved dog will be 10 years this april. 
He is a bichon and pekingese mix. He is a small sized dog. However he is overweight for his size. He has been like this since I left home for college and parents started to feed him more. 

He went throigh a lot of health issues (food alergies or dog fights - he is kinda mean with every other male dog - he is a male too). But he surpassed every issue. I always took him to the vet in my small town


- I tried to take him with me where I live now but he can‚Äôt adapt to living in a flat, at home we have a big yard and he loved outdoors. He just destroyed my flat, ate doors and walls, so I took him back to my parents

- Parents (my mom mostly) overfeeds him because my dog simply asks for food. And mom just gives it to him so he would stop barking. 

- After he developed a food allergy, he went on a diet with some special food and everyone stopped giving him other thigs to eat. However he never lost weight. He either steals food or hides it or we can‚Äôt explain how he still is fat. 

He is around 10-11 kg. For his size is almost double. However he was always very flexible and the weight didn‚Äôt seem to bother him even though I tried to help him lose weight in my time as home... which was not enough :(


- 3 days ago my dog suddently paralysed after I left home. Mom told me he just couldn‚Äôt use his back feet at all. He would look sad and sometimes moan in pain. 

- mom took him to vet and the vet said ‚Äòit is just the age‚Äô. 

It seems a bit weird and sad to me the vet just said it. A friend of us has the same breed mix and that dog has 18 years now and except for a cataracta in one eye, that dog is super fine. 

My dog is not even 10 years yet. I don‚Äôt want to lose him. 


The vet gave him some anti inflamatory pills and made him an injection. 

After 3 days my dog started to crawl like he tries to move the legs but still can‚Äôt use them well. 
My mom takes him in her arms outside in the morning and night for him to pee - he can‚Äôt even lift his leg, he pees on the ground. 

He also hasn‚Äôt pooped since the incident 

He now eats only diet food. He seems to have an apetite. He drinks water and waves tail sometimes but he is in pain I can see it. 

He tried to walk to me when he saw me and he moved like his spine was broken in half. His back legs were moving super weird more like not moving at all and he fell after a few steps. 


- i mention we don‚Äôt have super sophisticated tools in my small town and the vets are ok but not super extraordinary. 

The next good vet clinic is around 2-3 hour drive by car. My dog can‚Äôt yet go with me in the car so far away. He hates cars and becomes agitated...


**my question is how can I help him get better? What is the real issue or what should I be careful at? I can‚Äôt believe it is only ‚Äòthe age‚Äô. Also how can I make him lose weight since he can‚Äôt move now, he eats diet food but still didn‚Äôt lose weight at all. Do dogs have these metabolic things as humans? I am not good at it maybe someone can help me**



- Also I have to mention my dog did not fell off anything. Noone injured him or hurt him. He never leaves the house area and we have walls around the yard. He didn‚Äôt get in contact with anyone except my family. They just said the only symptoms were: 
1. He couldn‚Äôt bark - he sounded like he had a flu and his voice was damaged

2. The paralysia thing all of a sudden. 


He is now under treatment with anti inflamatory pills. I am not sure for how long he will take the pills, maybe 1-2 more days. 

Also he does not take any analgezics, doctor did not give him so he is in pain, but he still eats. He is just more sad and interacts less with us :(


I hope someone can help him. I want him to live!! ",6,1518961347

In 5 days mostly all the symptoms left, we gave him brit care back, the diarrhea got worse every day. Went back to cooked food, and things got better (still loosy stool and sometimes small  round yellow dots)  On the second week we went to the vet for vaccines, i told her the story, and she gave us fenbendazol, for 7 days for giardia (other symptlm: my dog lost 2 kilos since last vet visit in january!). Cooper recieves nexguard spectra every month, thought he cant have any other parasite than giardia. But now im concerned that nexguard and fenbendazol are not killing all the worms?! We finished the 7days protocol with fenbendazol and on the 9th day (today) he had diarrhea again, with those damn yellow dots.. Still on cooked turkey/rice/pumpkin diet with probiotics. Could be that thing in his stool because of the rice? Or some worm species that survived all this treatment? NSFW photo from today in comment :( We will go back to the vet of course.",12,1518810311

We‚Äôve changed his food from Blue to Wellness, we‚Äôve tried shredded chicken ‚Äútoppers‚Äù from Wellness, soft dry food bits and so many other things to pair with his normal kibble. Everything works for a week, then he will get bored of his food and hold out for something different. Worse is, he won‚Äôt fall for getting the same thing again. 

Now we‚Äôre stuck in a rut where we struggle to get him to eat. We‚Äôre trying to disconnect him from getting multiple items with his food, but he‚Äôs being incredibly stubborn and he‚Äôs in the middle of a day+ hold out. He‚Äôs even slyly sneaked to grab some of the cats food.

So the past week or so I‚Äôve been putting pumpkin in his food and now his feet are just a big mess. I‚Äôve been racking my brain and that‚Äôs the only change that has been implemented. So I stopped the pumpkin last night and bought a new bag of dog food just in case it might have been a bad bag. 

Soaked his feet in an Epsom salt bath, gave him a benodryl, and wiped his feet with medicated wipes. Is there anything else I should be doing?

He seemed to be doing great when we got home‚Äîhe drank and ate his dinner. He was moving around with no difficulty and seemed in good spirits. But as the night as progressed his movement became more stilted and now he cannot walk on his right front leg at all. It appears to be the same leg as where he had the IV. And it‚Äôs swollen. Could it just be a temporary reaction to the IV placement? 

But I‚Äôm also concerned because at the vet he jumped off the exam table before I could grab him. He gave no sign of pain or distress and walked normally for a few hours after that but I‚Äôm terrified he broke something or maybe cause damage to his spine or collar bone? 

Anyway I‚Äôm sitting up with him. Fortunately his diarrhea hasn‚Äôt returned. I will take him to the vet morning but his leg hurts so much I can barely move him. I‚Äôm so scared he has real damage because I didn‚Äôt hold him or because I told them to use the IV. I hope someone here can help me not freak out for the next few hours until the clinic opens.

My neighbors all have male dogs that are not fixed and they keep mounting my old female dog. As I said, she is in bad health and her two pups were constantly fighting with her. I brought her inside to spend as much time with her since I think she won‚Äôt be alive much longer. I put her outside during the day on a runner. Multiple times throughout the day I look out and one of the male dogs are on her. I have talked to them and told them I take a low powered B.B. gun to their dogs when they‚Äôre on my female and they laugh. These are larger dogs. We had another older female dog that died from a complicated pregnancy already after one of these dogs got her. 

I know shooting a dog is cruel and illegal, but I fear for my older dogs life if she ends up pregnant.

We took him to the vet and he is on cage rest for 2 weeks. My SO was home Sunday and Monday to carry our 70lb pup up and down the two flights of stairs so he could potty outside like normal.

He‚Äôs not using any of them. He has pooped once on our balcony, but hasn‚Äôt peed in 24 hours. He isn‚Äôt dehydrated, he‚Äôs been drinking a ton of water with chicken broth. I don‚Äôt know how to get him to pee. Hell, I‚Äôll take peeing on the carpet at this point.

DogCare,7tpejo,elcamino45,1,Crazy behavior during long walk,"My dog is normally a very energetic boy. Because of this I usually take him on long walks to make sure he gets plenty of exercise. Since the Midwest has experienced a little bit of an unusual heatwave I've been upping the frequency and length of his walks (tired pup is a good pup). Well on this last walk as we were coming back he got into a craze. I mean he really went nuts to the point that I got cut from the leash burning my hand when I went to grab it. I was worried a few times he would wiggle out of his collar. He was bounding and laying down a lot, but I was almost worried he was going to bite me. He got over it after about 5 minutes, but it was just so out of character it almost frightened me. It also just happened completely out of the blue. No triggers. 

He just turned one a few days ago and is a border collie if that matters. Anyone have any suggestions or know if this is normal behavior? Will they act out if dogs are over tired?",2,1517195553

Within the last 6 months my partner and I have noticed (and stepped in) some behaviour changes. Everything is fine and dandy, then all of a sudden he‚Äôs peeing and acting very submissive. He‚Äôll lay on his back, cock his leg up and show us his manhood! 

Situations this has happened in:
- Playing with a ball in living room. ‚ÄúGimmie that ball! C‚Äômere, c‚Äômere.‚Äù  *stops playing. Dribbles on floor*
- ‚ÄúCome get your toys out of our crate! C‚Äômere!‚Äù *dribbles on floor*
- ‚ÄúTime to get off the bed, buddy.‚Äù *dribbles on bed*

We neither get angry at him when this happens or reward. I know it has to do with him being confused - he just seems too eager to please that when we ask something of him and he doesn‚Äôt know the command, the waters of Pee River start flowing.

I am new to this sub and looking desperately for help. We‚Äôve adopted a 1-2 y/o what appears to be lab/basenji mix. He is a rescue dog. We were told he is lab/heeler mix, but after having him for about a month it became apparent he is basenji mix.  He looks like one, acts like one, very intelligent, gentle, etc. Simply a super dog. However, the problem comes with feeding him. He is an extremely picky eater. When we got him, we would boil chicken for him (no bone), mix with rice, potatoes,  veggies, and all the food we eat. He was on meds and we wanted to take it easy first 10 days. He loved the food and loves everything we eat, but absolute refuses to eat dry food (apparently basenjis have this issue). We tried sooo many different food. Cheap, expensive, farm/family businesses made, popular brands, and none seem to work. At pet clinic we were told to experiment and the he would not starve himself and eventually eat. He does, but only not to die. He lost little weight and now we noticed little more shedding (none before on home food). He is super smart and I suspect he doesn‚Äôt want to eat dry food because he knows its bad for him. However, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good for him. I can‚Äôt make him a 3 course full cooked meal everyday while meeting his nutrition needs. I also can‚Äôt keep buying bags of dog food and take it to a shelter after he refused to eat it. Tried samples and also no-no. What do I need to feed him? Please help!

DogCare,7oxbvq,bradenhm,0,Free Dog Walk! (My gift to you all!),"Hello!

My name is Braden and I'm a dogwalker for a service called Wag. I don't mean to sound like a commercial, but I was given a gift from the company that I thought y'all would appreciate: money towards professional dog walks!

Wag is a service where you can choose to have certified, background-checked dogwalkers walk your canine children. And you can do it all from their app!

If you download the app and want $20 towards your first walk, you can use the code they gave me: BRADEN6164. $20 goes a long way on the app (the average half-an-hour walk is usually $12, not including tips).

If you want more information on Wag, here is the website: wagwalking.com. Once again, really don't mean to sound like a commercial, I just wanted to give you all something from one pet lover to another!

Thanks! ~Braden",0,1515401927

DogCare,7oqr20,sgtro10,3,Puppy with loose stools,"I have a four month husky/German Sheppard that I got about a month ago. She‚Äôs due for her second round of vaccinations tomorrow. As per the vet‚Äôs suggestion, she hasn‚Äôt left my backyard or interacted with any unvaccinated dogs.

Yesterday around noon i noticed she had loose stools. I checked them out and they didn‚Äôt have blood in them, just her normal color but very watery. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because she does like to play with everything she finds and I did catch her drinking water from a few puddles in my backyard since it‚Äôs been raining for a few days already. All her stools since then have been like that and this morning when I took her out the stools have gotten even more watery, coming  out as a little jet of brown fluid now. She‚Äôs still running around with the same amount of energy and is eating/drinking normal, with constant access to both. I‚Äôve only seen her throw up once and it was a little wad of semi-digested food.

Her food is IAMS for puppies and the occasional small milk-bone treat. we don‚Äôt give her table scraps at all.

Is this reason for concern or is it maybe just an upset stomach? We‚Äôre already due at the vet tomorrow, but if it‚Äôs serious so I can take her for emergency care today.",4,1515334388

DogCare,7nvzjn,drinkingshampain,3,Dog is stressed over squirrels. Help!,"Hi Reddit, 

I have a 2 year old mixed breed dog (possibly a terrier mixed with a pitbull or bull terrier?). We live in an apartment building and squirrels will sometimes run around the courtyard area, our fire escape, and on the roof.

When she hears them, she goes crazy alert and wants to hunt. Once they're gone, she seems very stressed after and won't really let it go. She paces and whines and even if we play catch with her or try to keep her distracted she keeps going over to the window to obsessively sniff and whine. Sometimes she does this even when we don't hear or see the squirrels running around. 

I don't want her to be stressed out or frustrated because she can't chase the squirrels! What can we do? ",1,1514999234

DogCare,7nug4f,homebeforemidnight,1,Toilet training,I‚Äôve got a pug x which is well crate trained and hasn‚Äôt had an accident in the house for a few months. He‚Äôs pretty lucky and generally gets 3 walks a day. Once in the morning as a toilet and sniff break. About an hour after I finish work. And another one a night before I go to bed. The last walk of the day is that I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs going to the bathroom without going for a walk. I generally have the back door open and he can go outside at anytime to go to the bathroom. I‚Äôm not sure if I still need the last walk at night as a toilet break if the door is already open for him to go to he bathroom? Sometimes I find myself walking him quite late which is annoying. Would it be ok to cut this lasts walk and just get him to go outside more? This is probably a rambling post but I‚Äôm writing it from bed. ,1,1514983934

DogCare,7nmrbu,akirafox,1,King Charles Spaniel seems bothered - not sure what's wrong. Advice?,"So I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and while I'm not sure exactly how old he is, he's getting older and is probably around 10 years old (although he still acts like a puppy). 

He's always been relatively quiet and only whines and barks when he's excited (playing or going outside), but over the last month or so I often find him whining/crying at seemingly nothing. He's also scratching around the shoulder area? (sorry if that's a bad description, it's above his front legs). But he scratches there very often, along with licking/chewing around his back legs. He does this very often, a lot more than he used to, and while he's had fleas in the past we've used various flea treatments and combed him extensively yesterday and found nothing so I don't think that's the issue.

I looked around online and none of the possible things this could be seem to match how he's been acting, since he doesn't yelp or seem like he's in pain and seems happy apart from this. It's worth noting my stepmother passed away last month who he was quite attached to, but I don't know if dogs are aware of that and if that's why he whines for no reason sometimes. Sorry if my description isn't great, if you have any questions I'll try to answer them.",2,1514903756

DogCare,7mcl7j,ernietinkle1,2,Seven month old dog is acting aggressive,"I am currently dogsitting my family friends 7 month old golden labradoodle. He is potty trained and the owner said he is trained but the past few days he has been acting out of control some times. If he gets excited, he starts trying to bite me and my family, especially my hands and my ears when I am sitting down. We pull him off but he just keeps trying to bite our hands and legs. We try to put him in timeout but he just runs away and comes back later, barking loudly at us and again trying to bite. The only way we can calm him down is by shouting ‚Äúno‚Äù at him and holding one finger at him (the owner said that usually works but it is not working). The first few days he acted fine and nothing was wrong but he slowly started to become more and more aggressive. We try a lot of things when he starts barking, letting him out our backyard , taking him for a walk, giving him his toys, food, and water but he just comes back again and starts barking. The owner did not give us any treats as they don‚Äôt seem to work well with him. 


Are we neglecting to do something? How do we stop this type of behavior? We try not to shout at him but he just does not stop until we do and putting him in timeout in his cage is really hard as he keeps running away and disobeying our ‚Äúsit‚Äù or ‚Äúdown ‚Äú commands. I try to spend a lot of time with him and he does act fine sometimes. But after engaging with him for a while, he gets aggressive and starts trying to bite.  Sometimes if I am just sitting around on our couch, he climbs behind and on top of me and tries to lick/bite my ears. I try to bring him down but then he just tries to bite again.",4,1514346357

DogCare,7m4948,sledgetooth,10,Mothers dog with hypothyroidism and hip dysplasia without portion control severely overweight. Need help with reducing food intake without underfeeding.,"She's 130~lbs. She's being fed 5~ cups a day of Purina Pro Plan, equating to roughly 1700 calories. This isn't including 1 50 cal treat, and daily peanut butter. The dog is fed once at 5PM and eats intermittently at her leisure. Generally I don't think there's much leftover the next day, so she seems to be mostly eating in the evening and night. Furthermore, there are 2 other dogs. They're fed enough food so that there is leftovers. Who knows if the large one is eating any of there food.

Now, I've told my mother to cut out the treats and peanut butter. I would like some advice on how much to reduce the feed by, what time of day to feed the dog, and how many times a day to feed her. My mother works, so generally breakfast and dinner (two feedings) is ideal. 

This dogs quality of life is being sacrificed. The dog watches other dogs running freely and she struggles to walk, but wants to run so badly. She generally goes for a 20~ minute walk a day, in great spirits but definitely struggling. The fulcrum joint, basically the ""wrist"" of her paw, has so much pressure from weight, it's nearly touching the ground when she walks. When she isn't going for walks, she barely moves. Any insight would be extremely helpful.

DogCare,7kwi5b,caminator2006,0,Dog all the sudden acting very bad,"Hi, my family has a Boxer/Mastiff and hes about 7ish years old. Ever since we got him from another family, our dog has been VERY aggressive with strangers. We dont know why but hes scared of any other people and has just always been very protective (started out as just food aggression). However, he has always been very loving to my family and a really good dog. His only problem is aggression with strangers. Now our dog has begun trying to chew up presents under the tree (something he would normally never do) and a few days ago, he got out and my mother had to chase him around the neighborhood to where he got mad at her and was snapping at her. Today, my mother was outside with him and she tried to bring him inside. For some reason, he got really mad at her and started snapping and clawing. He got her pretty good in the arm.

We have no idea why hes acting so bad or what we should do about it. We used to walk him a lot but stopped for a while. I just walked him again a few days ago and after that he started to be more aggressive, so that could possibly be why? Any advice on what to do? Thanks",4,1513719690
DogCare,7kv7z6,alepolait,5,How to socialize adult dogs?,"I adopted 2 dogs (actually just one and the other was abandoned in my property) both adults (around 1 year) and both with a lot of issues.

I have no way of putting them in another place without passerby people. So they stay almost all day barking at neighbors and such. I have no access to trainers, and the situation with the pitbull is especially worrying I suspect he was abused because a lot of the aggression is in defense mode (he will bark and show teeth but at the same time he will recoil and try to hide between my legs) i don‚Äôt expect them to be fully trained, but I want to learn about how making them more comfortable in situations with strangers and other dogs (taking them to the vet is a nightmare, they always have to be drugged) thanks!",3,1513708630

DogCare,7i104b,jard18,3,My dog tries hard but can't pee/poop. Vets couldn't find the reason so far.,"TL;DR:
My female 12 yo dog tries hard but can't poop. Vet said she doesn't have stones/cancer/infection or something blocking her colon but had a very full bladder. Another vet suggested a X ray to check for a back problem. The first vet said it is unlikely, because she can walk/run normally. What else could be her problem?
 
Full story:
My 12 years old female dachshund started to try to pee/poop very often without success.
 
Just some urine came out, no feces. I can't say if she was actually trying to urinate or defecate, she was constantly making a position almost touching the vulva to the ground and stretching her tail. I could see urine everywhere she tried. In some places reasonable amount. She had a lot of appetite and was drinking a lot of water. The first day she was behaving like this, there was a lot of fireworks in my neighborhood that made her desperate. I can't remember if it was before/after I noticed these attempts to poop. I'm sure it was in the same day.
 
The second day that I noticed she was behaving like this I brought her to the vet. She was looking depressed and walking with the tail in between her legs, attempting to urinate/defecate all the time. I thought she was constipated, because I couldn't see feces for 3 days. But the vets said her problem was actually a dangerously full bladder. They made a short surgery to empty her bladder and find out what was going on there. The first guess was cancer or stones. Also, a full bladder was probably squeezing her colon, so that's the guessed reason for not pooping.
 
The thing is, they made the surgery and discharged her bladder BUT couldn't find anything wrong.
No cancer neither stones. No infection though some blood coming from her bladder walls, apparently from the stress of the urine overcharge. 
A back problem is probably not the case, because she behaves normally and walks/runs and has a happy tail sometimes.
So they said it must be a nerve that controls her urination and recommended a expensive drug to deal with it. We are trying this drug now, but they didn't have any explanation for the fact that she has not pooped for (now) 6 days.
 
Today (day 3 after initial vet consult) she is still in the hospital, with a catheter to empty her bladder, but she is still making those movements trying to urinate/defecate. I've already paid a lot of money and I'm hopeless. I went to another vet who said it must be actually a back problem. The other vets said it's unlikely because she walks normally and don't seem to have problems to move, which should come together. At any rate, I requested a X ray and hope for a back problem.
 
Is there any other possible cause apart from a back problem? ",8,1512593355

At his first vet appointment the vet told us his previous owners probably didn't give him much exercise as she said his rear legs weren't well muscled.

This weekend we took him to the park both Saturday and Sunday and he got a LOT of exercise. We ran around and played fetch and worked on recall from a distance.

However yesterday and today he seems to be more tired than usual. He wasn't as excited to go on his afternoon walk yesterday and was sleeping more than usual last night and this morning. Is it possible he is overtired or that we gave him too much exercise?

He is acting 100% normal other than the sleepiness, he's still eating and drinking normally, and good natured if I ask him to do something.

Is he overtired? Is there anything I can do to help him get his strength back? And in the future to avoid tiring him out too much?",4,1512491360

DogCare,7hqchn,caffeinosis,3,16-week old Puppy having feeding issues,"This is a dog that was really fearful/skittish when I adopted her at 11 weeks but has made a lot of progress. She's always been inconsistent with food, e.g. she would seem to be indicating that she's hungry a couple of hours before feeding time, then ignore her food when it's put in her bowl, only to eat like she's starving an hour later.

After doing some reading here and elsewhere, I've been trying to train her to the strict feeding times, putting her bowl down and taking it away if she hasn't starting eating in twenty minutes, and she doesn't seem to ""get it"". She missed both feeding sessions yesterday, then slept in her crate (where she eats) last night instead of on the floor beside my bed, but when I tried to feed her in the morning, nothing.

I know if I leave it out all day for her, she'll eventually eat, but that's sometimes problematic because there is another dog in the house that's food-aggressive. 

She also eats enthusiastically if I deliver it in a novel or stimulating way. I found a food dispensing toy and she went bonkers over that (I would have to load it three times for each feeding) for three days and then decided she wasn't interested in it any more. This morning I found that she would eat her kibble if I scattered it on her crate liner a handful at a time (but wouldn't eat from her bowl). I tried a different, plastic bowl instead of her metal one but she wasn't any more interested.

Is it better to stay the course until she figures out she needs to eat food out of the bowl when it's put there? So far I haven't held out past two missed feedings without giving in and bringing the food back later, or looking for novel/stimulating ways to feed, or whatever.",6,1512487507

My mom declared we cannot afford this and should put him down. My 13 y/o brother is scared of homelessness so he agrees with mom. My dad and I consider my dog like we consider our family, so we want to get him the surgery. We just don‚Äôt know how to swing it. Is there anything we could do? Is there some charity to help?

He also has been drinking tons of water and eating a lot more. He also gets lost in the backyard and will bark until I go get him. He goes to the wrong side of the door ro go in and out and constantly paces, and pretty much sleeps all day if he's not outside for a ""pee"". He is completely deaf and pretty blind too. When he is up he is still somewhat full of energy (for his age) and runs around and plays with the other dog for a couple minutes before going back for a nap. He also started not caring about rules lately (such as trying to jump on the table to steal food or stealing food off of the coffee table if we are eating in the living room). My family thinks it is time to put him down (it was a family dog I had growing up that I took into my own home as an adult) but I find it too hard to do myself. My mom booked him in for his euthanisation tomorrow night (I let her take him for a few days as she wanted to spend some time with him on his ""last days"" as we feel his time is coming whether we do it or he just goes).

Right now they shampoo the carpet each time its happens, it works initially but then the shampooer starts to smell (obviously) and the roommates take awhile to change it. I don't really expect them to change it every single day but at this point I think it should be approached differently.

DogCare,7cxyf6,GSDPottyProblems,3,"Dog is eliminating indoors, I've tried everything with no success, and now I'm in danger of being evicted","I tried posting this in /r/dogtraining, but it was removed and the mods won't tell me why...so I'm going to try here. If it's breaking the rules somehow, let me know and I'll modify/remove it.

I adopted my GSD, Aries, when he was 3 years old. He was potty trained, but had a lot of behavior issues because he was abused by his previous owner. It took about a year of intensive behavior modification training to get him to the point where I could introduce him to guests and to other dogs without it being a giant ordeal. Since then, he's been well-behaved and hasn't had any behavior issues, up until about a year ago. He did have a lot of medical issues, which my partner and I were easily able to pay for. Some of those issues are chronic, so treatment for them will continue for the rest of his life.

Last fall I had to leave my partner after 8 years together, because he had become really controlling and emotionally abusive. I took Aries with me because he was intensely bonded to me, but indifferent to my partner. I left with zero money, and had to stay with friends until I was able to save up enough for an apartment. My first apartment was a tiny studio in a rough neighborhood in my city. It was cramped and uncomfortable for Aries. This is when he first started eliminating indoors.

At first I was able to curb this behavior by crating him when I wasn't home, and taking him for more frequent walks when I was home. It was only happening while I was gone, so I assumed he was just unable to hold it as long as he used to. Eventually I moved to a bigger apartment in a nicer part of the city, where there is plenty of space for him both indoors and outdoors. That seemed to have a really positive effect on his behavior and his mood.

However, a few months ago he started eliminating indoors again. It started with occasional peeing. I went back to crating him, and taking him on even more walks. Then he starting peeing on the floor even when I was home, sometimes within a few minutes of coming inside from a walk. That was really alarming, so I took him to the vet so they could run some tests. They said he probably had a UTI, though the test results were negative, so I started giving him antibiotics for that. It didn't seem to help the peeing. Eventually he started pooping inside as well. The peeing and pooping always happen in the same room - the dining room - and doesn't happen anywhere else in the apartment.

I went back to the vet, and they ran some more tests. At this point I've spent over $1,000 a month for the last three months trying to find a medical cause for his issue. The vet seems to be convinced that the problem is medical and not behavioral, but so far they haven't found the answer, and I can't afford to keep running more tests.

I took him back to his trainer, who was equally baffled. She suggested blocking his access to the dining room when I'm home, but Aries is 120 lbs and extremely strong, so every method I've used to block him has failed. She then recommended keeping him in his crate even while I'm home, and only let him out for walks. When I tried that, he got extremely depressed, and started becoming self-destructive, pulling out his hair and biting his paws until they bled. When I went back for a third session with the trainer, she said she was out of ideas and said she thought it was a medical issue.

Meanwhile, my neighbors have started to complain to my landlord about the smell. He has contacted me twice telling me I need to get it under control or he'll have no choice but to evict me. I really, really can't let that happen, for obvious reasons. I shampoo the carpet multiple times a day, and fill every room with air fresheners, but because Aries is so large, the smell is really powerful and, since he keeps peeing and pooping, it's hard to completely eliminate the smell.

I've now maxed out all of my credit cards and put myself into debt with friends and family, all to try to take care of this problem. As I mentioned before, he has other medical problems that require expensive medication as well. I can't afford to keep taking him to the vet for tests that are only getting more expensive. When I was living with my partner, we had 3 times as much income as I have on my own, so I had no problem affording any medical treatment for Aries, but now it's become a real burden.

I'm at the point where I'm ready to give up and rehome my dog. It absolutely breaks my heart, because we're so bonded to each other, and I made a commitment to take care of him for his whole life, but I really don't know what else to do. Would rehoming him (through a reputable rescue group) make me a bad person, and mean that I couldn't adopt another dog again in a few years when I'm more financially stable? Are there other things I could try that could fix this incontinence problem? I'm so stressed out every day because I'm worried about my dog, about going homeless in the middle of winter, and I've isolated myself from my friends and family because I know my apartment, and probably my clothes and my car, smell of urine.

Can anyone please help me figure out what to do?",16,1510686729

DogCare,7cjzjr,Cererna,5,What's the difference between brand name raised dog beds (Kuranda/Snooza) and generic ones?,"In Australia if that helps.

So Kuranda dog beds are available here but they don't have breathable fabrics available in Australia which is bad because my dog is wooly! In that case, the second option with airflow is [Snooza](https://www.snooza.com.au/raised-beds/flea-free).

For sizes, the Kuranda(Large) would be $140, the Snooza(Large/X-Large) would be about ~$100-120. I've seen generic ""trampoline"" ones like [this Bone Designs](https://www.mypetwarehouse.com.au/bone-designs-steel-frame-dog-bed-black-3-large-102x69x21cm-p-25125)(Large) for $80 or [this random Gumtree one](https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/north-melbourne/pet-products/pet-trampoline-bed-extra-large/1164161229)(X-Large) for $70. 

So the differences can be quite huge for generic vs brand name. I think the main difference would be the warranty, for Snooza they have lifetime guarantee on flaws/defects I think and all their parts can be bought separately if it breaks. Otherwise, they all pretty much have the same design and quality I would assume should be pretty good for an otherwise plain design for that price.

Any thoughts? Worth just shelling out the extra money to get the Snooza?

DogCare,7bklnu,BurnKnowsBest,4,Help with sick dog,"Reddit, I need your help. My dog, a 5yo 75-pound pitbull boxer mix, got sick a few days ago. About a week ago, he started having diarrhea. This was a few days after starting a new bag of dog food, Pure Vita Chicken &amp; Brown Rice. (This was only the second bag I had bought of this brand.) I returned the bag and moved him over to a diet of cooked chicken &amp; white rice, but that didn‚Äôt help‚Äîhe got worse. His eyes started to look sunken. His mouth hangs open. He became very, very lethargic.

I took him to a vet immediately. They ran blood work and everything is fine except two things: his potassium is quite high and his calcium is quite low. They then tested for Addison‚Äôs Disease and it came back negative. The vets are stumped. They recommended I give him 3 1000mg Tums crushed into his food twice a day. 

In the last day, his energy has come back (we went for a 3 mile hike today) but his mouth is still hanging open and his breathing sounds...labored, almost like his throat is tightened or restricted somehow. When he goes to his water dish, he drinks for 3-4 minutes at a time, but the water level never drops much, which means I think he‚Äôs having trouble swallowing. When he eats, he doesn‚Äôt chew so much as scoop things up in his mouth and swallow them whole.

What the hell is going on. My vet says is not likely food-related, but I‚Äôm not sure. Could this be an allergy to chicken? To rice? His diarrhea is back tonight‚Äîhe‚Äôs had to go twice in the last 5 hours (and in the middle of the night).

Starting tomorrow, I‚Äôm putting him back on his old food, the kind he ate for the first year-and-a-half of our relationship. (He‚Äôs adopted.) 

But I need your help. What‚Äôs going on?",6,1510138456

I was living in North Carolina and getting ready to move to Atlanta. I came home from a funeral one day and my roommate said she left her outside and said she must have ran away but I didn‚Äôt believe her.  My dog might chase squirrels but she‚Äôs domesticated as heck and doesn‚Äôt like being outside for too long. She‚Äôs a Yorkie named Heidi. 

I looked for her and left some clothes outside in a crate, figuring she may have gone too far and got lost. But she never came back and eventually I had to move. I live in Atlanta now, and it‚Äôs been 9 months. 

I was searching the lost dogs site in my old city (I do this sometimes because I really can‚Äôt just give up on my dog like this) and a dog that looks just like her is on there. I know it sounds crazy but I‚Äôm driving up there in the morning to see if it‚Äôs her. It‚Äôs a 4 hour drive and it will be totally worth it if I get to come home with my dog. 

I would read stories about dogs traveling thousands of miles to reunite with there owners. But my little pup is too small to travel all the way out here and find me. She does have a great sense of smell though. 

I hope it is her. I lose sleep some nights thinking about if she‚Äôs ok or not. I really hope its her. It‚Äôs just got to be. 

The pound opens up at 11 tomorrow am and I want to be the first one to get there when they open. Should I bring a toy or some covers for her? Do you think she will remember me? ",12,1509246103

DogCare,796q10,JennyReason,7,"Dog sometimes pees while we're gone, pattern is mysterious?","SHORT VERSION: Is it worth trying to figure out the pattern of when our dog does and does not pee in the house when we're gone, or will it not help that much?

LONG VERSION:
We adopted an 8-year old greyhound a few months ago. We crated him when we were gone when we first got him, but he has some separation anxiety and we thought that he might be happier if he were able to hang out in the main room and sleep on his normal dog bed, so now he roams freely through most of our little apartment. We've done a lot of alone training, not making a big fuss when we leave or return, and the other standard suggestions for SA.

After 4-6 weeks of this, he is *usually* okay when we leave. However, sometimes he isn't, and his stress manifests itself mainly as peeing in the house, but also occasionally in yowling or in chewing on the coffee table, a Kleenex box, or whatever else is handy. (He will also *never* eat any treat you give him to try to keep him occupied when you leave--he saves it until you get home and then eats it after greeting you.)

For a while I *thought* that I'd figured out the pattern. My theory was that he is okay except in two circumstances: if no one is home as it approaches his dinner time, and if my spouse and I leave the house at the same time. Acting on this, we've been gradually moving his dinner time later and later with the goal of making it 7 p.m., when one of us is basically always home. Two days ago there was a huge traffic jam and I didn't get home until about 7:15, but he seemed fine. Then yesterday I got home at 6:45 and he had peed in several places, including the carpet, which is a new thing (previously he had confined himself to the hard floors). It also occurred to me that the only times my spouse and I really go out together without him are late afternoons or evenings--if we're going somewhere during the day we basically always take him with us. So I don't know if it's being alone in the evening or us both leaving simultaneously that he doesn't like. 

If we can't address this by figuring out the individual situations that are problematic and working on those, any ideas what we should do?

(We're going to consult our vet next time we go in, of course, and we could put him back in his crate but overall he really seems happier uncrated.)",2,1509145447

I used to live with two roommates and he never had any potty issues as I always took him out before work and right after.  However, one of my roommates started working from home, and I noticed whenever she wasn‚Äôt there during the day (went into the office, ran errands) my pup would pee in the house.  This led to resentment from my roommates and confusion on my part and I ended up moving to my own place.  He has never once peed in our home, even if his schedule is thrown off a little.

Now, he splits time between my place and my SOs.  For clarity my SO works in an office, has a dog himself (the two pups get along great) and a roommate.  The roommate works from home every once in a while but will also be gone during the day sometimes.  Obviously if both dogs are at my place for the day there‚Äôs not an issue. But my dog is starting his old behavior of peeing at my SO‚Äôs house if the roommate is randomly gone for the day.

I‚Äôve tried taking them for longer walks so he‚Äôs not antsy, I‚Äôve tried avoid ‚Äúcelebration hellos‚Äù when I come home so he doesn‚Äôt get excited, and the other dog doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues with accidents.

With my other dog(doesn‚Äôt live with me, stays with my parents now), when he got neutered he wouldn‚Äôt eat his kibble, so we gave him wet food. I figured this puppy would be tired and would want some wet food too.
I gave the puppy(he‚Äôs 8 weeks) some puppy wet food around 10pm and around 5am he threw half of it up and then again around 7am threw up again. I figure it‚Äôs from the food change. I bought some of the frozen fresh dog food, mixed it with water, and he still won‚Äôt eat. His tummy has been making noises all day, he won‚Äôt eat or drink anything. His pee is pretty yellow. Just heard he ate a few pieces of kibble (giving him blue buffalo wilderness the red meat blend-there was no chicken left at petsmart) and that‚Äôs all. What can I do for the pup? 
I read online I can put some low sodium chicken broth into his water, or some pedialyte into his water. Also read that on an upset tummy, they should eat bland food, like boiled chicken and white rice. Should I force him to drink water threw a syringe or baby bottle? Not like stuff a cup down his throat but like half an ounce at a time. 
I got my other dog when he was around 5 months so he was pretty much in stable health conditions. I‚Äôm worried about this puppy since he‚Äôs so little, and could easily become dehydrated or sick.

What do you guys think I should do? Sorry if I sound like a worried pup mom, I am. If he doesn‚Äôt get better by tomorrow, I‚Äôll take him to the vet. ",14,1508956809

DogCare,78fsqo,Alienplatypus,6,Can someone help explain this behavior?,"Hi all, this is my first time here so hopefully it‚Äôs the right place for my question. Our new puppy is about 9 months old now, so it‚Äôs very possible the answer is ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a puppy get over it,‚Äù but it‚Äôs our first dog so I was curious if there was a better answer. 

Basically every time we approach her, she growls and snaps at us, but then immediately starts playing and rolls over and we pet her and everything‚Äôs fine. But every single time the initial reaction is as if we snuck up on her or we‚Äôre coming to attack her. It doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs alone or if she‚Äôs sitting with us. She was on my lap and my dad walked up and she growled and then snapped at me! I had been sitting with her the whole time and as soon as anyone comes up it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs in defense mode. But like I said, it‚Äôs only like that for a second and then she‚Äôs ready to play or be pet or anything else. And it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs defending a toy or a person or anything because sometimes she‚Äôs laying in the middle of the floor and she‚Äôll do the exact same thing. 

Can someone explain what this behavior could mean and if there‚Äôs anything we should do to avoid it? Sometimes when she snaps she does bite a little and we don‚Äôt want that happening with a visitor. Thanks!",7,1508852479

DogCare,787d4p,boostedgts,2,Dog eating issues.,"Hey everyone. We have a 1 year old Corgi who seems to have become seriously picky over the past couple of months. When he was a puppy, he was eating Blue Wilderness until one day he refused to eat. He would refuse to eat to the point he wouldn‚Äôt poop anymore and his belly would growl continuously. We changed his food to Core Wellness. He‚Äôs been eating it like a banshee. Until, once again, a few days ago he refused to eat until the point of not pooping and his belly would growl continuously. We‚Äôve given him toppers for his food and everything, he will eat for a few days then refuse. We just bought a large bag of food, so I‚Äôm not interested in changing his food again. This cycle has to stop. What should we do?

He‚Äôs incredibly healthy, good weight and just saw the vet for his last set of shots not too long ago. He‚Äôs been neutered and everything. 

I want to let him starve until he figures it out he should eat his food but my wife wants to coddle him until he eats, just enabling this behavior for the future. The dogs incredibly smart but we don‚Äôt really know what to do. Food is too expensive to just keep throwing large bags away or donating all the time to adhere to his picky lifestyle.

Thanks in advance. ",2,1508761522

DogCare,77xj4u,JennyReason,6,"Sheathes have fallen off of a few of my dog's nails, what should I do?","Hi everyone. We recently adopted a lovely 8-year-old greyhound. He's been to the vet a few times and hasn't been diagnosed with any foot-related medical issues. Lately I've noticed that part or all of the sheaths of a few of his toenails have fallen off, leaving a rough surface underneath.

When this happens, there is no blood and he walks normally. He doesn't seem to be in pain at all--in fact, I really picked at one the first time I noticed it because I thought he just had dried mud over the surface of his nail, and me touching it and prodding it didn't even wake him up.

When I try to research this, pretty much everything I find is information about cases where the nail itself has torn or come off, and/or the quick is affected, and/or the dog seems to mind what is happening, so I don't really know A) if there is anything I can do to make sure the lack of smooth sheath over his under-nail (or whatever the hell it is) doesn't start to hurt him and B) if there is anything we should feed him that might cut down or stop this happening in the future. It's not bothering him now but I worry it's a sign of poor nail health that might hurt him if it gets worse.

I'll ask our vet next time we go in, but since he has an appointment in a week anyway and it doesn't seem to be bothering him it seems like overkill to take him in sooner.",2,1508637117
DogCare,77vwfr,jadely,5,How to gain weight?,"I have a 1.5 year old dog who should be a little over 50 lbs due to his size. Unfortunately he's never met the 50 lb mark. The vet isn't overly concerned because he is very active and lives a relatively healthy life. He's also 1/4 husky and 1/4 malamute, so the vet says he may only eat what he thinks he needs. 

The major downside to this is when he gets sick he stops eating but tries to maintain the same level of exercise, causing him to drop weight fast. If you dont want a long story you can skip from here and go to the next paragraph. A couple weeks ago he learned how to open doors and broke into my bedroom while I was at work and ate a play station controller. The vet gave us some meds and sent us on our way, but he went 5 days without eating causing him to loose 6 lbs. After a week he gained back 2, exciting the vet more than me. I went on a trip and he stayed at a dog boarding place where he got to run around with other dogs for 8 hours a day causing him to loose those lbs he'd gained back. Brought him home and after a few days he gained some weight. Had some constipation, possibly from the treats at the boarder, and lost weight again. He's eating again, but very under weight.

The vet wants us to take a more passive approach and let him slowly gain his weight back and just accept that he'll be perpetually underweight. I'm not really comfortable with that... if I was 5 ft 6 and 100 lbs my doctor would assume I'm anorexic! How beneficial is the raw food diet for gaining weight? He currently eats core wellness raw rev, and will continue to regularly because the raw food diet seems super expensive. But would a couple times a week be beneficial in helping him reach his healthy weight?",2,1508618726

I tried multiple brands (Nature Balance, Blue Buffalo, Wellness) but she doesn't like kibbles anymore. 
I tried mixing it with wet food and I also tried to leave her food out for 30 minutes and then take it away for a few hours or until the next meal. 
She eats some but not enough. Oh, I also tried feeding her by putting her food in a Kong or in a puzzle, it works for a few kibbles and then she just take all the food out of the puzzle and leave it in the ground.
She has not been loosing weight, but she hasn't gain any weight either. I have a vet appointment in 2 weeks.

I was thinking about switching to dehydrated food, but the only brand I could find is The Honest Kitchen and it is really expensive. Has anyone tried mixing it with kibbles? Do you have any other suggestions?

DogCare,7516k6,OldDemon,3,Dog ate packing peanuts.,"So a few moments ago I was asleep and was awoken to the sound of chewing. I noticed my dog was under a chair, jerking like he was eating. I was so tired that I just ignored it. Then I a few moments later I decided to go check. I caught him curiously sticking his head in a box that had packing peanuts in it. When I caught him there was one in his mouth, so it's safe to assume he probably ate a couple of these things. 

I did some research to find out how safe this is for a dog and I read that it should be okay if they are biodegradable. So I took a few of them and put them in the sink and poured warm water over them. After a minute or two the peanuts dissolved completely. Also, when they come in contact with water, they sort of shrivel up and get very sticky. They are white and cylindrical. Are these the safe kind? Or are these still dangerous?",2,1507462071

DogCare,74xdqm,WhatASpicyMeme_,4,Dog is getting bald patches,"Reaching out for any help; a dog (that shouldn't be in the care of his 'owner') that I tend to when I can, is starting to get bald patches on his underbelly. He has bald areas around his armpits  And around his genital area. His genital area is more pinkish looking than the rest of the balding spots. Now I'm not sure if it's due to a number of things, so I will just name a few factors that I think are probable:


1) it's the deck he's sitting on; the deck is never cleaned, (I always have to clean it, and I don't always have time to tend to the dog) he usually poops or pees Ina a corner, but it's gotten everywhere as of late. He sits in shit and piss if it's up to his owner; it's been raining lately and I'm not sure if the stuff is getting washed around?  


2) it's his fleas
I have tried to treat him time and time again, I personally thought they were gone, but there's always the off chance that they returned, or never left. 

3) it's a form of mange. 

I haven't noticed any scabbing,  but I could always look closer. I bathed him with dishsoap and moved him into a hygienic area for now. 

Can anyone advise? I've done pretty much all I can. I can't afford to take him to the vet and I just want him to have a good life. (I'm appalled any human being would treat a dog like this, his 'owner' does literally nothing but drink and watch TV all day)",9,1507409282

My group is designing a collar that sends its data to a mobile app with the goal to help owners better aid their dogs. Please answer however much you want.

Also, it would be useful for us to know how experienced you are in dog care. Thanks.

1. Which is more important to you‚Äì understanding vitals (heart beat, general health) or daily needs (feeding, exercise)?
   - question is vague so interpret it however
2. What worries you most about your dog?
3. What would you like to be more informed about your dog?
4. Would you be interested in a feature that reminds owners about their dog's medication?
5. Do you worry about misreading new dogs? As a new owner, do you worry about not understanding dog behaviors?

 Does anyone have any suggestions for strong dog toy balls that come in different sizes (small and larger so the little dog can actually pick them up)? ",3,1507083822

Now she stopped showing interest in treats. We tried different kinds but no budge. 

It‚Äôs a general off behavior of her usual personality. Please help with any advice, thank you.

DogCare,73i77b,mrsfishpants3,2,Dog being aggressive suddenly towards other pups?,"So my dog is a silkie mix terrier thing, so he is a pretty small dog. When we are home for the summer he is great with my moms dogs.  

We just recently moved back to school, and he has interacted with dogs his size or smaller twice, and they were not good interactions. First one was a puppy beagle and he snarled at it, then when I scolded him he wanted to chase puppy, but was not growling or showing teeth. Second time was about half an hour ago and basically we out walking and a woman's toy dog raced up to us barking and squealing so I picked up my dog in case the dog was aggressive/they didn't mix. While the owner was running over to grab him,  the dog jumped on me a couple times. He wasn't being really aggressive though. My dog lost it and started to squirm and snarl at the dog, trying to snap at him, etc. I apologized to the owner, the owner apologized to me, and we both ran off. The second the dog was not near me my dog relaxed. Was there anything I could have done? And why is my dog suddenly acting aggressive like this? Any advice for the future? Also the other dog did not have a leash on, and it was on my campus. ",6,1506813089

He gets about 3/4 cup of dry Wellness Complete + 1/4 cup of wet Merrick Grammy's Pot Pie (literally won't eat anything else).  We haven't added any new treats or snacks either.

He has passed gas on rare occasion but usually has no tummy issues and has nice clean, non-smelling uh bathroom habits.  In the last few months he began farting frequently.  There's no odor, pain or other discomfort that I can tell.  Only thing I can think of is age - do dogs suddenly get gassy?  Or maybe our pet food changed formula?  

Any ideas about what we can do?  He's poofing away as I type.
