Dogtraining,up6gla,kathiejay,1,Separation Anxiety- Adult Rescue,"Hello! I rescued an 8 year old dog last week who is experiencing some serious separation anxiety. In general, he is THE sweetest lazy, quiet angel- loves the car, tells me when he has to go out, cuddles, etc. He doesn't bark at all when I'm home- maybe one little yelp to go to the bathroom if I'm not getting the hint. When I shut the front door, however, he runs around frantically looking for me and howls and barks non-stop until I return, whether that be minutes or hours (the most I've left him is 4 hours), non-stop. Luckily, he does not tear anything up or urinate in the house. He also follows me around constantly at home and will not let me get more than 3 feet away from him.

I understand this new behavior is due to his environment changing and was prepared to deal with some of that, but I didn't realize how severe it would be. Unfortunately, my neighbor who I share a wall with works nights and sleeps during the day, so its not possible for me to let him do it during the days for time being in hopes it will lessen as he adjusts. I've had to be with him nearly 24/7 because of this and can't go to the office, grocery store, etc. unless I bring him with me.

The foster who had him for three months before I got him said he was crate-trained and even slept in the crate at night and that she did not have any issues getting him in there. I got him in the crate easily the first few times but he has now become terrified of the crate so I don't even try (although since I've stopped trying to get him in there he's become slightly more curious about it). She also said she had no issues with him barking whether or not she was there. The biggest difference between her house and mine is she had two other dogs and I don't have any other pets or people who are with him when I'm not there.

Here's What I've Tried:

* Leaving him home out of the crate
* Leaving him with a puzzle toy
* Putting calming music on
* Leaving the blinds open so he can see out (he never really looks outside anyway but he tore up my blinds the first time I left him alone)
* Taking him out before I leave
* Not making a big deal of when I leave or return

My question is: **is it too early to intervene with a trainer to address this?** I don't mind paying for it now even if it will resolve itself on its own, but I don't know if training will be effective during the transition period. And in the meantime, **will I disrupt his transition if I have to take him to daycare 2 days a week while I'm at work?** He loves other dogs and taking him 2 days a week could become his norm anyway, but I don't want to delay his adjustment even though it seems like the only option for the time being so I don't get kicked out of my apartment or fired. Any other guidance is much appreciated!

Thank you so much for your advice!",1,1652491750

So my year and 6 month pit boxer mix has recently started getting hyper and ""aggressive"" on his walks. I notice it is brought on by him not getting what he wants, as this time it was triggered by him wanting to cross the street. I tried to put him in a sit and wait and he refused to follow the command. then when i tried to turn him around to take him home he started jumping around biting his leash, biting at me (not hard like and attack just jumping and biting) and tugging on his leash. i had no treats but i tried to hold him down on his back to get him to stop spanking him. nothing worked except finally i held him down and bit his ear till he yelped and he finally stopped pulling on his leash and walking normal till i could get him home.

My wife says he also does it on his second walk of the day every time without fail (she takes him at 8 and 10)

Dogtraining,up2v98,ThrowingFinance,1,help! Dog pooping inside of house out of nowhere,"Hi friends.

I have a problem. 

My 1.5 year old cocker spaniel has decided to start pooping inside of the house. I do not know why. I cannot figure it out. 

We took her to the vet, got stool samples, and everything was negative. It's not diarrhea.  

She used to be fine at around 5 hour intervals for going outside. Now she doesn't wait that long. She doesn't give us any warning that I can see at ALL that she needs to go outside. She doesn't even start eating food until 6pm or so (we've tried to get her to eat earlier but she will not). 

What could be causing this and how can I start the work to mitigate this issue? Its been happening for about three weeks now and I cannot understand why. Nothing lifestyle-wise has changed, her food and training hasn't changed, we've been doing everything the same, but at least 5 times in the past three weeks this has happened. 

I'm going to start taking her out in 3-4 hour intervals instead, but I'm just trying to sort out why this could have started at this point and if it's something I'm doing wrong somehow. 

Thank you!",1,1652480156
Dogtraining,up2pta,throwawayooo3,1,1.5 year old red heeler/german shepherd unpredictable aggression towards family.,"We've had our dog Kirby since he was 9-10 weeks old. We love him dearly and have always given him the best life possible. He gets 3 walks a day, lots of mental enrichment, and from the get-go we trained him using only positive reinforcement and never yelled at him or used any aversive techniques whatsoever. We handled him a lot when he was a puppy, and neutered him at about 9 months. We are at a total loss for why this is happening. 

When he was 6-7 months old he began resource guarding everything around him. His sleeping spots, high value items, and even items that mean nothing to him, like a cloth on the floor near him. If he falls asleep near you and you move he will bite. Sometimes we cannot wipe the floor, he will run across the room and bite our hands aggressively. He has drawn blood many times. His resource guarding does not change when we go out of the house. He has zero aggression towards other dogs.

Putting his leash/collar on and off is also a gamble. We cannot examine him for fleas/any injuries ever.

The one that hurts the most is that he will, randomly, in the middle of petting sessions that he initiates, become vicious. There are *zero* warning signs. No growling, freezing, or whale eye. One second he is wagging his tail and nuzzling you for more, then he loses it. It's terrifying and heartbreaking and we are unsure if we are able to cope with it anymore.

We've already reached out to a behaviourist (the only one in a 1.5 hour radius) who recommended muzzle and crate training him. We've started that process but muzzle training him has been a slow and scary process. Once he is muzzle trained we plan to take him to the vet in order to rule out any medical issues. The behaviourist suggested it could be conflict aggression or rage syndrome and that anxiety medication may be an option.

Despite all of this he is still so playful, intelligent, funny, and can at times be sweet and affectionate. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this? Is there any hope? I love him more than words can say and it breaks my heart every time he has an episode.",2,1652479716
Dogtraining,up2ndk,Glowtrains,1,Our 2 year old rescue who we've had for ~7 months has recently started peeing inside the house?,"We adopted our 2 year old pit bull/Chihuahua mix back in October, and everything is going great. He warmed up to us quickly, he's become totally comfortable in our home, and he's really great about letting us know when he needs to go outside, so he NEVER used to pee inside the house.

In the last few weeks though, when we leave the house for short periods of time, he's started peeing inside. We always make sure to take him for potty breaks before we leave him alone, but when we get back, he's peed under the same specific table. It's happened about three or four times now, and he seems to be aiming for the stuff under/around the table. (The first time was on my sewing machine foot pedal, so I put it up, and next time he moved on to the fan next to the table, etc.)

I have a feeling it might be related to separation anxiety somehow? He's totally fine during the week, but it only seems to happen when we leave him alone outside of our normal work schedule, like running errands on the weekend or something, which makes me doubt that it's a health problem.

The problem we‚Äôve been having is inside. Any time we let him out of his crate sooner or later (within 10min), he starts going to bite at our heels or toes. Putting on shoes just made him chew on them instead. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing it aggressively, I think he just wants to play, but all of the advice we‚Äôve read online: yelping, ignoring him, leaving, just seems to encourage him to nip?

I was worried because Sweetie (lab) didn't understand how to play gentle with small things and scream barked when separated from the other dogs. I was scared that she could hurt the puppy and her scream barking would instill bad barking habits in the new puppy.  I got plenty of heat for that post, people telling me that we were bad for getting a puppy, we were endangering the puppy, etc etc etc

Luckily we managed everything and things have been [perfect](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shady_Scientist/comments/uoyzks/big_dumb_lab_behaves_well_with_new_corgi_puppy/)!  
I was likely over worrying but I think it was for the best because I went in with extra caution.

When we first introduced the puppy to the lab we kept them apart by a fence in the back yard for the first day, Sweetie was curious and very, very excited. Then we'd hold the puppy and ignore Sweetie, she freaked out for a few minutes then calmed down. After a few days of exposing the lab to the puppy with us humans in the way, she got over her excitement to the point we could set the puppy on the ground and keep an eye out.

Seems Sweetie has calmed down in the years since she was last around a small dog and she is totally chill with the puppy. The puppy however LOVES the lab. He just wants to climb all over her and chew on her like a giant toy. (maybe we need to protect the lab from the puppy instead lol)

Sweetie tolerates the puppy or just walks away. If the puppy is too annoying she'll come to us to rescue her, just as any not mentally handicapped dog would do.

A few times we've even seen Sweetie defend the puppy from our older corgi who growls at the puppy. Sweetie will walk between the two corgis and distract the puppy from the older corgi.  
(All our corgis seem to dislike puppies when they are older, they forgot that they were just as annoying when they were puppies bugging the other adult corgis)

I haven't been this proud of Sweetie since she learned how to back out of a doorway.

As for the barking concerns, we've been really lucky with this puppy so far. He only barks at the older corgi when being ignored and we can step in fast. I was scared that Sweeties separation anxiety barking would cause the puppy to have barking issues, but since Sweetie hasn't been doing that we've been good. So there is a good chance that my mom won't push to debark the puppy afterall!   
(the puppy does do a husky-like yodel/scream when we crate him and he wants out, I really hope he outgrows that because it scares me tbh)

Puppy has learned sit, working on wait and stay (the hardest imo)  
Potty training is ongoing, he does know that the sooner he pees when I take him outside the sooner he gets to go inside, just need him to learn not to pee inside and we're set.  
I've been brushing the puppy and touching his butt, tail, ears and toes daily. I want to start on dental care prep but his mouth is so tiny I can barely fit in a finger.

However, I‚Äôve come across a new issue recently. The daycare he‚Äôs been going to for almost 4 years recently told me that he may not be allowed full access to the play area because he has started nipping at the workers that supervise the play area. 

He‚Äôs always been like this and will try to get people to play with him, but they say that he has recently been nipping harder than usual, and it‚Äôs getting to a point where the supervisors cannot play with him the whole time as they have to make sure the other dogs aren‚Äôt playing too rough/getting hurt, et cetera.

We regularly go to the dog park (same one in our neighborhood) today there were no dogs there when we showed up but an older couple sitting on a bench. We decided to let him off leash (as we usually do at the DP) and did some training with treats (come, look at me, sit, lie down). The couple that was sitting began to walk towards the exit, he didn't seem to mind at first, then just charged at them and started barking and nipping, seemingly out of nowhere. 

My guess is that he was in a playful mood and expected to have other dogs- so was off his normal routine. These people were simply walking and trying to ignore him, thankfully. We quickly grabbed him and put him back on the leash, and continued home for the day..

There are other times on walks or hikes that he will bark at some strangers and not others. We have been trying to give lots of praise/ treats when he sees strangers especially if he listens to a command and is showing signs of relaxing. It seems to have become less frequent but worse when it happens. 

I am not a fan of shock collars- but if there is a safety issue for him and other people I am thinking that might be a good option. I am able to be very attentive and consistent with training, what I've seen and tried hasn't seemed to work. We would love to be able to have him off leash on hikes and at parks in the future.  I am desperate for advice and would love any input.Questions welcome. Thanks in advance.",1,1652468644

For the good: She's very sweet, loves kids and belly rubs, doesn't jump or bark very often, is potty trained, and seems to be pretty even-tempered.

The bad: She completely ignores her food but will gladly eat cat food and people food (I've told my mom to stop feeding her bc she begs when I eat), pulls on the leash (not as bad as it could be, it's more that she gets distracted and ignores me), and she won't touch her toys but tears up the garbage and recently, my books.

The only thing I've gotten her to eat that wasn't the garbage was a no-hide bone I thought I'd try, but she devoured it in the time it took me to get home from school.

I have plans to get a crate, as well as more bones and food-based chew toys like kongs. I also introduced clicker training and I'm going to work on the leash pulling.

Does anyone have any advice or tips to help with this? I've owned a German Shepard before, but I was always able to direct his attention onto a toy. She seems completely uninterested in the toys I bought for her.",2,1652464359

&amp;#x200B;

First time was just him and I and the foster mom in a parking lot.  He was very sweet and came right up to me.  

2nd time was the foster moms house, and she had a lot of guests over (that the dog knew) and a lot of other dogs.  He was fine, really calm and friendly towards everyone. 

3rd visit was to my house with my 2 roommates.  He was obviously a bit scared at first, let out some mild growls at my roommates and didn't want to be near them.  By the end of the 20 minute visit, he was warming up to them but still a bit nervous.  The foster parent told me this is normal for him, and he usually warms up, and he's never actually bitten anyone.

I am concerned about this mild aggression he displayed towards my roommates.   I would like to take this dog hiking where there will be other people on the trail, take him over to friends houses, outdoor patios for dinner etc..  If he assumes every stranger is a threat until proven otherwise, it could make life pretty difficult if I'm ever out in public with him.

He seems to be comprised of 75% storage space, refusing to use the bathroom outside. His previous owner had himself and several siblings living in a gated area with a potty pad made of artificial terrain that they would presumably go on. Now, whenever we take Kaine outside, he will just follow us around, or sit/lay in the grass, or stay on the patio and stare at us. We can spend 15 minutes coaxing him to ""go potty"" and wander him around, but he's just not having it. Then we go inside and if given 10 seconds alone he'll using the bathroom on the carpet.

He's never had any accidents in bed, he actually sleeps with me and has no problems during the night (it's been 5 days and he has yet to wake me up in the night to go), and when taken on walks he seems to rarely stop and fully empty himself. I'm just kind of looking for some advice here.

Dogtraining,uouu4g,Jsh0,1,Dog continuously barks when girlfriends dog is over at my house but not at her house,"Hi all, I have a 5 year old male corgi that I adopted about 1.5 years ago. My girlfriend also has a male corgi (who is 9) and recently (within the last few months) my dog has had a habit of continuously barking inside of his room whenever my girlfriends corgi is over. What will happen is my dog will walk over to the office, lay in his bed and just continuously bark (I'm assuming it's attention based). He will continue to bark for long periods of time in the office until it just stops without warning (usually these bouts can be 20-30 minutes of non-stop barking) but then can pick back up when he feels like it. We can close the door to the office but he will just continue to bark as if he were in the office. 

&amp;#x200B;

This habit only started a few months ago, prior to this both dogs were able to co-exist in my house without any sort of issue. The strangest part about all of this though, is that whenever I bring my dog over to my girlfriend's house, my corgi is totally fine he will coexist with hers and not bark. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of keeping him out of the office (which doesn't appear to have any effect) I have purchased a pheromone collar (which also hasn't had any effect), as that was recommended by my vet to help him with his anxiousness.

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional background about my corgi (in case it's relevant) he was an adoption, and he came to me with severe anxiety to which he's on 10mg of Fluoxetine for (he previously was on 20mg) - unfortunately the fluoxetine doesn't seem to do much for his anxiety, but when my vet suggested we try taking him off of it, he continuously started marking around the house (once he was back on a smaller dose the marking stopped). He's also on Keppra for seizures (which he has every couple months or so), and takes Metacam as he has chronic hip dysplasia (so he definitely has some medical shortcomings). 

&amp;#x200B;

I adopted my corgi in the middle of the pandemic obviously, and I was strictly work from home M-F. As a result my Corgi is typically in the office as that's where I was located from 8am-5pm most days (I'm still remote but only 3 days a week as opposed to 5). The office is where he sleeps at night as well (he is crate trained and walks right in to the crate when it's time to go to bed). I'm just not really sure what to try to stop this behavior, as it's pretty niche as to when it happens and only happens at my house and not my girlfriends, any help is greatly appreciated and I thank you all in advance.",0,1652457268

Dogtraining,uouk8k,OldGloryInsuranceBot,1,Should our dogs meet the neighbor's dog?,"We've got 2 dogs and a fence in the back yard that is nearly solid, with just small cracks between the slats.  Our backdoor neighbor got a dog a few months ago.  It rarely barks.  Because of the narrow fence gaps, from our house we can see a playful shadow running around their yard.  When our dogs hang out by the fence, the angle through which they can see anything through the fence is much narrower, and often they are surprised by the neighbor's dog as it suddenly passes by, so our dogs start barking.  I'm fairly certain it's a playful bark, and sometimes their dog responds.  Sometimes they chase each other along the fence.  Although my dogs are socialized and have other doggy friends they see, I love that my dogs found a playmate at home, (even if it's a ""boy in the striped pajamas"" situation).  However, I don't like that my usually nearly silent dogs have started barking more.  I usually try to break their attention by calling out to them or by just walking outside, and usually this gets them to stop for a few minutes until the friendly shadow runs past again.  No doubt I'm projecting my desire to be friendly to neighbors onto my dogs, but I'm considering asking my neighbor if the dogs can meet (on neutral ground) to say hello, and put a face to the shadow they've been smelling.  At best, the dogs will recognize each other's desire to play, and will exercise and run back and forth when they see each other without needing any alert barks or ""want to play?"" barks.  At worst, they'll start barking to call out to each other to come play even when they're not there.

My pup has always been ""difficult"" but our vet said we have made extremely great progress... but there is one thing my husband and I can't stop and honestly don't understand.

We will be walking down the street in our neighborhood and our pup will suddenly bark at people. The amount has gone down (started at 3 months and peaked around 5 months). 

* He almost never barks in crowds, we can walk right next to people and it's fine. We also take him to cafes/restaurants as practice and it was good 
* When he barks at people I believe he is **not scared**  (on very rare occasions he will be scared of a dog and he's completely different - tail down, curled back, raised fur, backing up) - he is usually jumping or trying to run towards the human
* He particularly likes to bark at children, which is very distressing to me. Particularly if they run across him, kick a ball, point at him, etc. But he has barked at adults who are running/biking (I believe we got him to stop that but you never know), trying to pet him, pointing at him, suddenly walking out infront of us. But sometimes he wont.
* I am trying my best to anticipate people and I am telling him ""good boy"" - then he wont bark. Sometimes I dont see people coming so maybe that's also why ""sudden people"" are more likely to get barks. Sometimes I see his little eyes look at people and I know the look, and I tell him ""good boy"" he looks at me and we can remain calm
* If I point at ANYONE/ANIMAL, he will bark at them. 
* He barks at our friends and jumps around them - though we have worked on training this a lot (off leash in home, or on leash outside).. he has trouble containing himself and he is most calm when people come over and he is in his crate. Once they are here a while and we let him go he is happy to see them but more calm
* Sometimes when even I try to pet him outside he jumps and then spazzes, bites his leash, play growls 

Background:

* He's a bunch of ""shepherd"" type dogs, he has Malinois blood and looks most like that.
* He is rewarded with treats for calm behaviour, calm greetings. 
* We have another dog, they are friends
* He's out 3x per day, gets mental stimulation
* He is very loving to us, way more than our other dog (who is more chill)
* We trained ""soft bite"" a lot, he's very good at it, and never hurt anyone 

Please any advise aside from ""get a trainer"" - it's complicated in this country... but something I am thinking about.

One challenging item for us though has been crating. We have two crates now after trial and error, one in our bedroom and one in my office where I work from home. The upstairs bedroom crate we put her in at night, close the door immediately, no treats or toys, and she is quiet for 8 hours. 2 of us in a bed where she can see us, and resident dog on floor bed on the other side of the room. Fantastic! 

The downstairs office crate we've been feeding her in, training with treats and phrase 'crate', made it super comfy (bought the same crate pads for both crates). Toss her toys in when I see them on the floor. She goes in and out of it freely/frequently, sometimes playing with toys sometimes to nap. Yesterday she was in it for 2.5 hrs napping with the door open. She spends all 8-9 hrs able to roam in three adjacent rooms, but mainly is in the hallway between them all, on my floor, or in the crate. Resident dog is blocked off in another half of the house and mostly spends time upstairs out of view, so not a factor.

Despite me sitting 7 feet from the crate, so far I have only gotten her up to 4 minutes in the crate before she starts howling and banging her nose against the gate door (roughly 8 attempts over Days 4, 5, and 6 today).

When he pulls I
- Turn around, doesnt help as he wants to go in that direction then
- Stop until he gets calm. Doesn't help, he continues when I continue and he rarely (99%) looks at me like ""when can we go?. 
- Snap the leash back (not aggresively) when I see his mind has wandered away from me, so I change the direction 180 and he follows, only to do the same thing. I can do this 30x in a minute and he doesnr't understand to look at me for guidance and that it's making him tired for no reason.

Went to a school, tried tips from other people, bought a harness, the leashes you put around their nose (horrible, 2 weeks of putting it off until he chokes on it every 10 seconds). Sometimes he would be okay with it after 30min, but that assumes there are no dogs/interesting things.

In 4 months we have managed to get it much better, but the only thing that helped the most is I walk in super random directions for A LONG TIME. 

I decide to go left and bump into him, if he's not paying attention it's his fault as he is pulling. It gets him confused after a minute until he figures the direction we are taking. It helps a lot, and walks can sometimes be quite good.

Treats and toys are absolutely useless, he somewhat walks okay if I give him food (tried many different) but he isnt't crazy about it and he never looks at me.

But even I'm stumped - tell me if I can improve or if I'm doing anything incorrect. Any and all feedback welcome.  


I have an adult rescue dog, nothing biologically wrong with her, she's been vetted so the potty training issue isn't medical. 

The first week, week and a half,  in house, she held poop for several days at a time, and pee for almost a day at a time. Going outside was sporadic and they were/are VERY fearful outside. Around the two week mark, when she started getting comfortable in house, the poor pup started voiding her bowels in her exercise pen. I get it - the pen is her safe space - and probably it feels like her ONLY safe space.   


1. Per dog training instructions, we never scold for potty mishaps. Very neutral - we clean up quickly and use enzyme cleaner thoroughly. I've fostered puppies before, so I know how to really clean.
2. We go outside 4x a day. 
3. Pup was just started on anxiety meds, but its been less than a week.   


Any other tips? Doggie diapers?  


 More often then not, we wake up to her poop and pee in the morning, no matter how early we get her outside. She's just too scared - won't take treats when above threshold, etc. It's not a sensory issue, she does go in the grass when she does go outside and she actually misses/avoids pee pads when we put them in her pen.

Dogtraining,uol7my,brainybrian1,1,Tips please haha,"So ive a 6 month month old pup called Stryder hes an unreal dog picks up things very well but can lose motivation during training quite easily. Now i fully believe that theres no bad dogs just bad trainers so thats why im here im looking for advice on how i can better communicate to him what i want. 

Background (feel free to skip)
Hes a rottie and belginan malinois mix so hes sharp as a tack, got him at 8 weeks from a friend whos dog had been pregnated accidentally by their neighbours dog. Brought him home to the parents house everything was sweet for the first couple months. But since we have a 5 year old in the house and parents' friends are scared of dogs since hes gotten bigger hes starting to cause some friction. The 5 year old i think has some jealous complex and think his spot as the last born is under threat so he does everything in his power to try get stryder in trouble haha stryder obviously being the bundle of energy he is just thinks everythings fun n games n falls into my wee brothers traps üòÑ but its mostly calm. 
Im just gonna list the few things i need help with in order to make the relationship more cordial in the house
1 respecting bounderies, this seems to be getting better with age but unfortunately stryder thinks everytime is play time
2play biting carying on from the first issue stryders idea of play is biting and nipping sometimes hard when he gets a little too excited 
3 staying in place, he knows to go to his bed, but wouldnt stay on the bed for any duration unless hes being bribed with treats then hell stay for as long as youre feeding him
4 recall his recall is about 100% reliable when theres no major distractions, but soon as he sees a cat, dog or moped (dont ask why) hes completely deaf to me and bolts off sometimes out of sight which is a concern considering he may grow to be 50-60 kg
5 and just general training how can i keep him engaged for longer during training sessions and what should i do if he completely checks out 
I know its a lot haha but any advise available is v appreciated, also side note thinking of getting an e coller as a last resort just to condition the word no much more firmly and maybe some recall work yay or nay?",2,1652422232

Dogtraining,uoky8y,i-am-over-eighteen,1,How do I get my dog to stop destroying things at night,"I have a 7 month old Male Doberman who‚Äôs potty trained, crate trained and is aware of basic commands. We got him for the purpose of guarding the house, so he is always left free to roam around the house(not inside) except the few hours when he‚Äôs in the crate. From the day we brought him home he‚Äôs been full of energy and very different from our previous dog, a female Doberman. She wasn‚Äôt as restless and naughty as this one. 

We give him running, fetching, jumping over sticks, hide n seek kinda physical activities everyday, as much as possible. But the thing is he‚Äôs always been destructive 
 
-Bit off the seat from the scooter, three times, like he‚Äôd bite it off, we‚Äôd buy a new seat, repeat. This happened for 4 brand new seats until we learnt to apply a little chilli powder and neem oil after which he doesn‚Äôt go near the seat anymore. But even if we forget for a day, the next morning the seat is destroyed

-Bit off the wire that connects to the submersible motor, wall light (which was inside the wall.. he managed to break open the casing and pull the wire out to bite it off) Luckily we rarely use the light so no risk of shock and he doesn‚Äôt go near the motor when it‚Äôs running

-Last night he‚Äôs jumped on the back of the car and has bitten off the name badges and completely scratched the shit out of the car boot

Other things that he has destroyed include cycle tyre, mudflap, bike indicator wire 

It is becoming a chore trying to hide things from his sight but I‚Äôm not sure where I can hide the cars and two wheelers except in the garage. 
Can‚Äôt put him in the crate all night either because that would destroy the purpose of having a dog in our case. We‚Äôve already cordoned off the garden with wire mesh because he kept destroying plants from the pots and littering soil all over. 

Any suggestions would be helpful. TIA",2,1652421163

With me he gets ready to fight like I am going to hurt him. Full on snarling, he will fight for his ""prize"" and that is risky for my fingers. I hadn't done anything different than what the rest of my family has done. I present treats the same way but there have been a few close calls with my fingers if I get too close.

This only presents when he has a random object that isn't food or what he knows as his toys. He will warily let me touch, grab him, whatever in this state.

Dogtraining,uoidjf,JyasuL,1,Cafe Manners: what do you think is general etiquette for bringing your pups to a cafe/restaurant?,"Hey Reddit,

What do you expect from your pups when you take them out to a restaurant or cafe?

For me personally when I bring my 2 labs, I bring 2 mats and enrichment items (lickimat/kong toy/yak cheese chew). I don't let my dogs meet the other dogs in the cafe as I don't want to disturb the owners during their meals. I generally choose a location where my dogs won't get surprised by pedestrians/dogs and can see them coming as one of my dogs tends to get a shock. My pups are not to leave the mat until we're ready to leave. Also, they ignore the servers and other people unless we tell them to ""say hello"". And of course, they are not allowed to counter surf.

Does anyone do something similar for their dogs? Does anyone do anything differently?

Dogtraining,uogrsd,Rubymoon286,1,"My senior is going blind, and is mostly trained on visual cues, having to shift our training to vocal at nearly 12 years old.","The last few days have been hard. I noticed my pup was not responding to his visual cues and bonking himself on furniture. We had a vision test yesterday and he's lost enough vision that he's not really seeing our visual cues anymore. At nearly 12 years old, we're focusing on shifting his cues to vocal that matter for safety, and I can tell he's frustrated by it all. 

A little background, Brodie is a Aussie/Chow/ACD mix and he's never been food motivated. He was very difficult to train initially as we adopted him from a pretty rough rescue situation at 9 months old. Loud vocal cues would cause him to cower and flinch when he was a puppy so we worked around that as best we could with visual cues for the basics, and he did SAR for many years too (He retired in 2020 due to one of his CCLs blowing.) With SAR, he has a few vocal cues relating to the work, along with some gently spoken ones for safety (""Drop"" (an immediate downstay no matter what's going on"") ""Leave it,"" ""Split"" (which is stop engaging with the dog you're playing with and come to heel) 

Now to the meat of the problem. I am at a loss for what cues are super essential at this age to reteach him beyond ""wait,"" ""heel,"" and maybe ""settle.""

Dogtraining,uoftxh,LovesHerJello,1,Reactive German Shepherd,"We have had two dogs, a male 4yr retriever mix (he currently has fungal pneumonia) for 3 years, a female 15 yr old 5lb poodle mix for 2 years. We recently had to move into my in laws house and are limited to one room to keep the dogs and us in.

There has been a German Shepherd (5 yr old male) here for about 5 years, one of the siblings got the dog as a puppy and he's been completely neglected the whole time. Rarely got fed, never got water, never seen the vet, outside all the time (we're in Texas so extreme heat and cold is a problem), never had a soft place to lay, had fleas, has heart worms, has a skin condition, and is intact. I couldn't live here and not take care of him so we've taken him in. We've taken him to the vet, got vaccines, got flea and heartworm meds, and we're going to start heartworm treatment soon. He's on a feeding schedule, gets water, we've started medicated baths, and he's been inside with us basically since we've been here.

The poodle mix liked him at first and the retriever has been pretty indifferent, didn't mind his presence, didn't try to insert dominance at all. We soon learned that GS had food aggression, he snapped and went after both the others, we started feeding him separately from them. However, the other two have become cautious of him. Everything was okay until today. The retriever had a stare down with the GS and the GS snapped at the retriever and it turned into a fight. Retriever didn't stand a chance, my husband and I were able to separate them with minimal injuries. 

We have a crate that all the dogs love to be in so we have the retriever and the GS taking turns being in it. We can't leave them outside because the heat index is in the 100's and again we are limited to our room in the house. 

I can only assume the trigger was the retriever trying to protect me? I had walked into the room and the GS was right in front of me as I walked in that's when the retriever came over and got defensive. They had a stare down before this incident but nothing happened and I'm not sure what the trigger was. The GS always seems to feel guilty and always wants to make up after, but the retriever holds grudges.

The owner of the dog hasn't lived on the property for pretty much the whole time the dog has been here. They tried to take him recently, but he got into fights with their spouse's dogs so they dropped him right back off in the yard here.

My husband opened the door a crack to help carry in our baby and items from the car, and our dog shot into the street and ran up to the other dog. He didn't attack him, he kept running up to him, running away, and circling back, but the other dog and his owner (a young teenager) were rightfully scared. Fortunately nobody was injured, and one of my neighbors managed to capture my dog's attention (my dog loves saying hi to all people). Clearly what happened was unacceptable.

If it doesn‚Äôt work out with them meeting then the cat can stay in the room (she usually stays in the room anyways). Maybe my friend will have to find another spot but for now this is the situation.

When adopting my (now 9 year old) shiba inu. It said in his adoption ad that he was good with cats. Since having him I‚Äôve only shown him to two cats and one instance wasn‚Äôt the best. He opened his mouth at the cat very slowly but the cat swatted and backed off. But he seemed curious and confused. Not exactly aggressive just dangerously curious I guess? The other time he sniffed the cat and was curious and then the cat swatted and he backed off.  

The third time wasn‚Äôt an introduction but worth mentioning. He was 2 years old and I brought in a cat from the street. I never introduced them but he was non stop clawing at the door and was so eager to know what was behind the door. He has since been neutered though. Maybe worth mentioning?


He does see cats in the streets and he just looks at them and when they go running he runs after them which worries me. 

The cat coming into the house is good with dogs but will swat if the dog is being annoying or needs it. She is overweight which could be an issue if she needs an exit plan around him. 

My dog is also not really the best around other dogs which worries me with the cat situation. He is reactive (fearful aggressive) and territorial. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same around cats but it does concern me. 

How can I slowlyyyyy introduce them? I won‚Äôt be leaving them alone together ever.

TDLR; best friend has no where to live so them and their cat are moving in and my dog has a high prey drive and has never been around cats. limited cat exposure. i want to know how to introduce them slowly",2,1652391862

Dogtraining,uob48x,myou-i,1,"19yo, unqualified for taking care of a puppy","Hello. I am an au pair living abroad for a month (have already been here 1) with a host family who has just got a shih tzu puppy. She's very lovely, energetic, a super sweet dog and I enjoy looking after her. But I've been given a lot of responsibility with her that I didn't really realise I was getting and now I'm here I want to make the best of the situation.

She is not house trained. My host mum takes her out in the mornings before she goes to work and feeds her. She is then not back home until 8-9pm, as she works a very demanding job (hence why I am here). The host dad spends most of his time in another country. And the kid is 12, so he is at school the whole day. I take the puppy out around 11:30, feed her at 1, then take her out again at maybe 2:30 and 5:30 before feeding her again at 7. She never poos or pees whenever I take her out and I have absolutely zero idea of how to train her to do so. Today, within half an hour of taking her out and coming back, she pooed once and peed three times in separate places (inside the house). There doesn't seem to be any pattern with when or where she does it, just apparently never outside lol.

I'm at a loss. I don't feel like I can leave her alone for more than a couple of hours at a time, and I'm basically cooped up inside the house because of it. She doesn't have a pen or cage I can keep her in when I go out, so she just roams the kitchen/dining room and it becomes a game of 'find the poo' whenever I return. We also do not have a garden.

Ideally I just want to be able to go out for 3 to 4 hours at a time, take her out before and after I go, and know that she will be okay in those in between periods. I'm not here for long, so I'm not expecting to make much progress with her - I know that once I'm gone, the host family will quickly realise just how much responsibility the puppy is. But if I can just give the poor thing a bit of structure and not have to be clearing poo off the floor 3 times a day, that's enough for me. Any help is much appreciated :)",1,1652389394
Dogtraining,uo9qs7,wtfisthiswtfisthatt,1,Why does my dog yelp when strangers pet her?,"I have an 18 month old dachshund that I‚Äôve had since she was 9 weeks old. We socialized her by taking her to many different training classes which she loved and I also sometimes take her to work. 

The last few times someone has asked to pet her she barks at them but then stops and gets excited. Then she‚Äôll submissively roll on her back but as soon as they touch her belly or chest, she yelps like she‚Äôs being hurt. I never force her on people, she runs ahead of me. And she never used to do this.

The only time she isn‚Äôt around us is an occasional doggy daycare visit. Admittedly she doesn‚Äôt seem to like going.",0,1652385832
